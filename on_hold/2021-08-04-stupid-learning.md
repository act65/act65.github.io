Despite all the hype and fancy footwork. At it's core, learning is quite simple (I mean simple in the sense of stupid).



Other names for 'learning'.

<ul><li>Fancy averaging.</li><li>Ask my neighbor.</li><li>Trial and error.</li></ul>

And if we have a finite amount of memory, then compressing things becomes important!


Occam's razor! and MDL!
