I came across [nationaldebtclocks](https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/newzealand) and found myself hypnotized by our increasing debt, it just keeps going up, fast.

I did a couple of quick calculations and I figure that every NZer pays ~$1000 NZD per year in interest on our national debt (_138 $/sec x 60 sec/min x 60 min/hr x 24 hr/day x 365 day/yr divided by 4.7mill person = 925 $/person_).

(Note_: the_ [_treasuries_](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/liabilities) _estimate of our liabilities is $197.1 billion, which is a lot more than the nationaldebtclock’s value for our debt. ~$16,000 per person per year -- at 4% interest._)

Also, we are paying 4.8% interest per year, which is far higher than my bank will give me... (_4,360,121,813 $/yr / $90,814,035,922 = 0.048 -- from nationaldebtclocks_)

I have **questions**!!!

- Why are we in debt? Why is it necessary for governments to borrow capital from investors?
- What is a [government security](https://www.nzdmo.govt.nz/), and why would I want to buy one? Who does buy them? Why do they get such good interest rates? And why would the govt want to sell them?
- Where does the interest on our national debt go? Who do we owe it to? And how do these financiers/investors contribute to NZ?
- Why do we own [$30 billion in shares](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/financialstatements/yearend/jun17/21.htm)? What are those shares invested in? (it better not be oil, sugary food, alcohol, dairy, facebook, ...)

Time to investigate.

Why are we in debt?
What is the purpose of debt?
How is micro-lending (which seems like an unambiguously good thing) different?
Why is it necessary for governments to borrow capital from investors?
How much?
How much does the average wage earner pay in interest?

https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/newzealand

Interest per Second NZ$138
138 $/s 60 s/m 60 m/h 24 h/d 365 d/y ~= 1000 $/y. Every NZer pays $1000 per year. Or every wage earner (half of NZ) pays $2000 per year.

But the treasuries number is $197.1 billion. Which is a lot more than the debtclock. $8,000 per person per year (at 2% interest).

What if we wanted to pay the debt off? In the future we wouldnt have to pay the interest. (!?!? assuming the govt didn't put us back in dept…)

NZ has one of the lowest debt/capita in the OECD (or does debt/gdp matter more? -- debt = 34% of gdp. fuck.).
Where does it go?
Where does the interest we pay go?
Who do we owe money to?
How do these investors contribute to NZ?
More questions

Huh, so the treasury does a bunch of forecasts. How accurate are they? How accurate are their models? Should we be using them? http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/forecasts
Why do we have $30 billion in shares? What are those shares invested in? (better not be oil, sugary food, alcohol, dairy, ...) http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/financialstatements/yearend/jun17/21.htm
