title: What can we learn about the universe?
---

I am excited by the application of learning theory to the natural sciences, for example; the [learnability of quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608142), or the [learnability beyond the diffraction limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07659) or [evolvability via learning theory](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2643031/Valiant_Evolvability.pdf). I would like to see this approach taken further!

> What are the limits of our ability to learn about the universe?

Maybe some facts about the universe are unlearnable because there is only so much data we can collect, or there is too much noise in our measurements, or it would take too many computational resources. I want to know the limits of what science can tell use about the universe.

Both of the references are about the learnability of states of the universe.
There are more, similar, open questions. For example;

- Does the interaction between measurement and quantum state mean that we will never be able to learn about the hidden states that could make quantum mechanics determinsitic?
- Is it possible to observe the (non-equilibrium mechanics ... ?!?)

Finding new ???

- Does the computational complexitity of analysing the porperties of molecules, and the sheer number of possible molecules, mean we will ...?

But what about learning models to explain those states?

- Will there ever be enough accurate data to specify a unique model that can answer questions about the origin of the universe?
-

Or exploitable physical laws that allows you to learn more quickly.

- Relativity >>!?!?
- Quantum ...!?


Does the way we use the scientific method mean that it will be very unlikely that we discover X?

Learning theory applied to the scientific method!
