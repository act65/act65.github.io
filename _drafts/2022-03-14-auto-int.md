From the first fundamental theorem of calculus;

$$
F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) ft \\
F'(x) = f(x)
$$

Automatic differentiation has proven useful.
What about its sister? Automatic integration?


### Setting.

We have $f, df$. We want $\int f(x) dx$.
The efficiency of our method is calculated by the number of calls we make to $f, df$.



### Why would anyone care?

>  it is well-known that finding an anti-derivative of a function is much
more difficult than evaluating the derivative of the function.
(ref https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15210.pdf)

What kinds of integrals do we care about?

- PDEs?
- Applications??!?
- Expectations?
- Volumes?!
- ?

### Well. That already exists?

Trapezoid rule and Simpsonâ€™s rule.
Runge Kutta.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods
etc?

Approaches.
- Use derivative info to adapt the step size.
- Monte-Carlo.
- Learn a NN with known integral form.
- Symbolic manipulation to find an integrable form??

Ideas
- Find integrable fns that lower and upper bound f.
- Decompose fn into a (linear) basis of integrable functions.

### Non-integrable functions

A function is said to be integrable if it has a closed form expression.
If not, it can only be approximated(?!?).


A closed for expression is;

- finite
- 

### Notes
$$
a_1\int f_1(x) dx + a_2\int f_2(x) dx = \int a_1 f_1(x) + a_2f_2(x) dx ??
$$



### Problems.

What about higher dimensions? Manifolds. Etc...
