Constriained search in the typical set is intractable for arbitrary distributions.
We propose a method to apply PITS to arbitrary distributions using neural flows.


<!-- how easily can we ask. is x in the typical set? -->


% TODO in which cases does $x - f^{-1}(\alpha f(x))$ approximate $\nabla_x p_f(x)$??

In general, the typical set, $\mathcal T_{p(x)}^{\epsilon}$, is intractable to compute for arbitrary continuous distributions.
However, we assume we have access to a flow that maps from clean data to a Gaussian source distribution, $f_{push}: P(X) \to \mathcal N(Y)$.

% (needs proof)
We conjecture that is it possible to use a flow to sample from the typical set of arbitrary distributions (see future work \ref{futurePOTS}).
This can be achieved by exploiting the structure of the flow-based models Gaussian source distribution.

For Gaussian distributions, the typical set has a simple closed-form solution, an annulus, with radius and thickness dependent on the dimension and standard deviation of the Gaussian.

% (needs proof)
Projection into the typical set for a Gaussian can be approximated via a 

Thus, we implement POTS as:

\begin{align*}
h = f(y) \tag{forward flow}\\
\hat h = \text{proj}(h) \tag{project onto typical set}\\
\hat x = f^{-1}(\hat h) \tag{backward flow}
\end{align*}

Next, we project the corrupted signal into the typical set to produce our denoised signal $\hat x$, shown as a green dot. The typical set is shown as a teal annulus. \label{f.A}}
