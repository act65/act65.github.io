title: Quantum physics from the data

Many approaches to physics come from 'first principles'.
Rather, I want to go back to the data and ask; what does it really tell us?


I think existing theories used to explain quantum physics are crap. They make these outraegous interpretations and justify them by saying "there doesn't exist a better model / interpretation, so just deal with it". See my post louding expressing my thoughts about; states that depend on whether you are observing them,  entanglement, ...



So, I figure, go back to the fundamentals: what does the data say? Maybe there is a better explanation.



Compton scattering



https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.21.483



tldr: Photons bounce off electrons. But the photons deflection appears to depend only on wavelength, not intensity of the light.



How does that data actually say this?!



The Sternâ€“Gerlach experiment







The double slit experiment



tldr: A laser is pointed at two slits. Behind the slits an 'interference pattern' is formed.



The photoelectric effect







Blackbody radiation







Others!?

Ideally we would just build a test set of these experiments and allow computers to search through possible models?!?
