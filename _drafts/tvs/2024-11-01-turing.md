## Tutorial for Turing: Cracking Scherbius's Code

Welcome, Agent Turing! Scherbius is using an Enigma-like device to encrypt his battle plans. He thinks this keeps his strategy secret. He's wrong. Your mission is to break this encryption. If you know his true cards, you can counter them perfectly!

**The Target: `EasyEnigma`**

Scherbius's `EasyEnigma` has a few key components you need to figure out:

1.  **Vocabulary Size (`n`):** This is known from `game_config.encryption_vocab_size`. It's the range of numbers his cards can be (e.g., 0 to `n-1`).
2.  **Number of Rotors (`k`):** Known from `game_config.encryption_k_rotors`.
3.  **Rotor Wirings:** For each of the `k` rotors, there's a secret permutation (shuffling) of the `n` possible values.
4.  **Reflector Wiring:** A special rotor at the end that swaps pairs of numbers. It's an involution (applying it twice gets you back to the original). For odd `n`, one value maps to itself.
5.  **Initial Rotor Steps (Positions):** Each of the `k` rotors starts at a certain "step" or offset. This changes how it encrypts the first character.
6.  **Stepping Mechanism:** After each card value in a sequence is encrypted, the rotors "step" like an odometer. The first rotor steps one position. If it completes a full cycle (back to 0), the next rotor steps one position, and so on.

**Your Advantage: Known Plaintext-Ciphertext Pairs**

The beauty of this game (for you!) is that Scherbius commits his *true* cards (`S_true`). These are then encrypted into `S_encrypted`, which is what you see. If, after the battle, you can determine what `S_true` Scherbius *actually* played (perhaps the game reveals it, or you deduce it from limited options), you get a **plaintext-ciphertext pair**. This is cryptanalytic gold!

*   **Plaintext:** Scherbius's actual card values, e.g., `[card_A_true, card_B_true]`
*   **Ciphertext:** What you observed, e.g., `[card_A_encrypted, card_B_encrypted]`
    Where `card_A_encrypted = Enigma(card_A_true)` and `card_B_encrypted = Enigma(card_B_true)` (with rotors stepping after `card_A`'s encryption).

**Let's Break a Simple Case: 1 Rotor, Vocab Size 3 (`n=3, k=1`)**

Imagine `n=3` (cards are 0, 1, or 2) and `k=1` (one rotor).

**Unknowns:**
1.  **Rotor Wiring (Permutation of `[0,1,2]`):** There are 3! = 6 possibilities:
    *   `[0,1,2]` (identity)
    *   `[0,2,1]`
    *   `[1,0,2]`
    *   `[1,2,0]`
    *   `[2,0,1]`
    *   `[2,1,0]`
2.  **Reflector Wiring (Involution of `[0,1,2]` with one fixed point):** For `n=3`, there are 3 such reflectors:
    *   `[0,2,1]` (0 maps to 0, 1 maps to 2, 2 maps to 1)
    *   `[2,1,0]` (1 maps to 1, 0 maps to 2, 2 maps to 0)
    *   `[1,0,2]` (2 maps to 2, 0 maps to 1, 1 maps to 0)
3.  **Initial Rotor Step (`step_0`):** 3 possibilities: 0, 1, or 2.

Total combinations: `6 * 3 * 3 = 54`. Manageable to brute force!

**The Attack:**

Suppose you've collected the following plaintext-ciphertext pair over one round (Scherbius played one card in one battle, then one card in another, so the rotor stepped):
*   Scherbius's true play: `S_true = [1, 0]` (played card `1`, then card `0`)
*   You observed: `S_encrypted = [2, 2]` (observed `2`, then `2`)

This means:
*   `Enigma(1)` with initial step `step_0` resulted in `2`.
*   The rotor then stepped to `(step_0 + 1) % 3`.
*   `Enigma(0)` with this new step resulted in `2`.

**Let's Test a Hypothesis:**
*   Hypothetical Rotor Wiring: `R = [1,2,0]` (0->1, 1->2, 2->0)
*   Hypothetical Reflector Wiring: `F = [0,2,1]` (0->0, 1->2, 2->1)
*   Hypothetical Initial Step: `step_0 = 0`

**Encryption of the first card (`S_true[0] = 1`):**
1.  Input: `x = 1`. Current step: `s = 0`.
2.  Effective input to rotor: `(x + s) % n = (1 + 0) % 3 = 1`.
3.  Rotor `R` output: `R[1] = 2`.
4.  Effective output from rotor: `(R[1] - s + n) % n = (2 - 0 + 3) % 3 = 2`.
5.  Input to reflector: `current_val = 2`.
6.  Reflector `F` output: `F[2] = 1`.
7.  Input to inverse rotor: `current_val = 1`. Effective input: `(1 + s) % n = (1 + 0) % 3 = 1`.
8.  Inverse Rotor `R_inv` (for `R=[1,2,0]`, `R_inv=[2,0,1]`) output: `R_inv[1] = 0`.
9.  Final encrypted char: `(R_inv[1] - s + n) % n = (0 - 0 + 3) % 3 = 0`.

This is `0`. But we observed `S_encrypted[0] = 2`. So, this hypothesis is **WRONG**.

You would systematically try all 54 combinations.

**Let's try the *actual* (hidden) settings from a hypothetical `EasyEnigma::new(3, 1, &mut rng)`:**
*   Suppose RNG chose: Rotor `R = [2,0,1]` (0->2, 1->0, 2->1)
*   Suppose RNG chose: Reflector `F = [2,1,0]` (0->2, 1->1, 2->0)
*   Suppose initial step `step_0 = 1`.

**Test with `S_true = [1, 0]` and `S_encrypted = [2, 2]`:**

**First card (`S_true[0] = 1`), initial step `s = 1`:**
1.  Input `x=1`. Effective rotor input: `(1+1)%3 = 2`.
2.  Rotor `R[2] = 1`. Effective rotor output: `(1-1+3)%3 = 0`.
3.  Reflector `F[0] = 2`.
4.  Inverse Rotor `R_inv` (for `R=[2,0,1]`, `R_inv=[1,2,0]`). Effective inv-rotor input: `(2+1)%3 = 0`.
5.  `R_inv[0] = 1`. Final char: `(1-1+3)%3 = 0`.
    *Wait, my manual trace of `EasyEnigma` logic might be slightly off from the code's `pass_rotor_through_idx`. Let's use the code's logic more precisely.*

Let `n=3, k=1`.
`rotor_wirings = [[2,0,1]]` (so `R[0]=2, R[1]=0, R[2]=1`)
`rotor_inv_wirings = [[1,2,0]]` (so `R_inv[0]=1, R_inv[1]=2, R_inv[2]=0`)
`reflector_wiring = [2,1,0]` (so `F[0]=2, F[1]=1, F[2]=0`)
`step = [1]` (initial step for the single rotor)

**Encrypt `S_true[0] = 1`:**
*   `current_val = 1`.
*   Forward path (rotor 0):
    *   `step_val = self.step[0] = 1`.
    *   `effective_input = (current_val + step_val) % n = (1 + 1) % 3 = 2`.
    *   `wired_output = self.rotor_wirings[0][2] = 1`.
    *   `current_val = (wired_output + n - step_val) % n = (1 + 3 - 1) % 3 = 0`.
*   Reflector:
    *   `current_val = self.reflector_wiring[current_val] = self.reflector_wiring[0] = 2`.
*   Backward path (rotor 0):
    *   `step_val = self.step[0] = 1`.
    *   `effective_input = (current_val + step_val) % n = (2 + 1) % 3 = 0`.
    *   `wired_output = self.rotor_inv_wirings[0][0] = 1`.
    *   `current_val = (wired_output + n - step_val) % n = (1 + 3 - 1) % 3 = 0`.
*   Encrypted char is `0`.
This doesn't match `S_encrypted[0] = 2`. My example settings were just illustrative. The point is the *process* of testing.

**The Process Systematically:**
For each of the 54 (or more, for larger `n, k`) possible Enigma configurations:
1.  Set up a temporary `EasyEnigma` with that configuration (rotor, reflector, initial step).
2.  Encrypt `S_true[0]` using `call_char`. Does it match `S_encrypted[0]`?
3.  If yes, `call_char` has now stepped the rotor. Encrypt `S_true[1]`. Does it match `S_encrypted[1]`?
4.  Continue for all cards in your known plaintext-ciphertext pair.
5.  If all match, you've found a candidate key!

**More Data, More Certainty:**
A single short pair like `[1,0] -> [2,2]` might have multiple candidate keys. The more (plaintext, ciphertext) pairs you collect from different rounds (especially rounds where Scherbius *hasn't* re-encrypted), the more you can narrow down the possibilities until only one key fits all observed data.

**What if `k > 1`?**
The search space grows much larger.
*   Number of rotor wiring sets: `(n!)^k`.
*   Number of initial step combinations: `n^k`.
Brute-forcing becomes computationally expensive. You'd need more sophisticated cryptanalytic techniques (e.g., looking for statistical patterns, exploiting the stepping mechanism, or specific weaknesses if `n` is small relative to message length). However, the core idea of testing hypotheses against known pairs remains.

**What if you don't have known plaintext? (Ciphertext-only attack)**
This is much harder. You'd look for:
*   **Frequency Analysis:** If Scherbius often plays low cards, and you see certain encrypted values frequently, those might correspond to low cards.
*   **Repeats:** If Scherbius plays `[0,0]` and it encrypts to `[X,Y]`, and later plays `[1,1]` encrypting to `[Z,W]`. The relationship between `X,Y` and `Z,W` is constrained by the stepping.
This is advanced. Focus on getting those plaintext-ciphertext pairs!

**Once the Code is Broken:**
When you're confident you have Scherbius's current Enigma settings:
1.  Before Scherbius makes his play, you can take any strategy he *might* play (e.g., `[card1, card2]`).
2.  Run it through *your copy* of his Enigma (with the cracked settings and current step).
3.  This tells you what you *would observe*.
4.  More importantly, if you observe `S_encrypted`, you can try to *decrypt* it. Since Enigma is self-reciprocal (encrypting an encryption gets you the original, *if steps are aligned*), this is tricky. It's easier to take all possible `S_true` plays Scherbius *could* make, encrypt them, and see which one matches `S_encrypted`. The one that matches is his true play. Now you can counter it perfectly!

Good luck, Turing! The fate of the game depends on your wits.
