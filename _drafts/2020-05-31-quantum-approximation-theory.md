title: Guarantees for approximations to quantum physics  
---

Ok. This bugs me.

We are going to assume;
- magnetic effects are too small
- protons dont move (Born-Oppenheimer)
- we can factor the electron density into independent (Hartree-Fock)
- ???

Ok. What is the maximum error we can get if we dont include magnetic effects? (are the average error?)
Is it always the case that magnetic effects are too small? In which cases is the assumption (in)valid?
What about the gain in computational efficiency by making this assumption?!
