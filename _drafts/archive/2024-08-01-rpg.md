As you gain experience you gain wisdom and knowledge, but lose intelligence, agility and strength.
Gain too much experience, you become unable to think, move or act.

<!-- key part of the game is to balance the experience you gain with its utility. 
the minimum amount of experience you need to gain to progress, but not too much that you will 'age-out' before you reach the end. 
aka. no farming. -->
