## Fight back against online radicalisation

How are people radicalised online?
<!-- from message boards, social media, etc. -->


## Detecting deep fakes

There do exist tools to detect (some kinds of) deep fakes.
However, they are expensive tools (require a lot of computational power).

Main question here is;

- what heuristics can we use to help us detect deep fakes?


## Automated corruption detection

Using public data, can we detect corruption in government?
We could estimate how much money officials are likely to have, based on their job title and history.
The difference between this and their actual wealth (estimated from open sources) could be an indicator of corruption?

<!-- is this done in NZ? -->
