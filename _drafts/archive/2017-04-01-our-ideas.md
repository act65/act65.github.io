You: _Why did you call it 'our' idea? Why are 'we' going to do anything? It isÂ obviously your idea, I haven't done anything. Are you trying to manipulate me?_

Me: _Yes. I am trying to manipulate you, I am also trying to manipulate myself. I did it for two main reasons; to dissociate myself from 'our' idea, and to lower the barrier for others. I want to work on ideas because they are good, not because they are mine. I think it is an important difference._

So go ahead, steal my ideas, use them and build on them. I don't care about credit, all I want is to be involved.
