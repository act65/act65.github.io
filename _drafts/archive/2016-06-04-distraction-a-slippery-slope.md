When am I most vulnerable to getting distracted?

### When I change context, but not task.

Some examples;

- migrating a blog post to a different blog, I got distracted and read some of my old posts, 30 mins later.
- while working on something I remembered I had received an email related to my work. I ended up checking my mail, replying to a couple, and then getting distracted by stackexchange.
- Reading a paper, and seeing an interesting link, which also has an interesting link, ... 1 hour later...

### When I finish a task/project/thought.

One of the most perverse thoughts that can lead to hours wasted _"I deserve a break for doing such good work."_ 

### When I feel like I am forced/expected to do work

I don't really know why, but I find that: whenever I have lots of work to do, regardless of how much I am interested in the work, I crave distractions. I think it may have something to do with wanting to be free of commitments.

 

I plan to keep updating this as more instances present themselves, as I am sure they will. If there is any testament to peoples' creativity it is their ability to justify a distraction.
