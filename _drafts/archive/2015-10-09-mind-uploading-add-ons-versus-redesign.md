How will we interact and communicate with our digital environments after having our minds uploaded to the cloud?

The way I see it, we have three options; create add-ons that plug into our minds or to rewire our brains via learning, or redesign.

The add-on for sight could be a program that would map a digital image onto a virtual eye. Where the digital 'rods' and 'cones' would be stimulated by programs, which then fed the information down a digital 'optical nerve' into our digital minds. Simply a transfer function, from visual input to nerve impulses.

Or we could retrain our brains to cope with the new structure of incoming information. Considering that our brain is capable of learning this may be feasible (not optimal).

Lastly, we could try to actively change the structure of our brains to be able to process new information formats, store more information, integrate information better, ...

But;

- To what extent do we need to redesign/reorder our brains for life in the digital world. Will we still be 'humans' after this transformation?
- The good, and bad thing, about the human brain is that is vastly interconnected. This means it is capable of parallel processing and association. However, if we wanted to say, get rid of our sense of smell, as it is possibly vestigial in the digital world, then removing this may affect things our sense of smell is closely related (and thus connected) to areas, such as memories, rewards systems, emergency response systems, and bodily functions...
- If the answer is using add-ons will humans always be limited by the structure of their brains?

Really, we want to find to a modular version of the brain. Where we can add and strip away functions, while still leaving consciousness. Where we can easily boost processing power and storage space without effecting other functions.
