Alexander Telfar thinks he is special and that he can change the world. Now that seems a bit cocky to me, we are all the same aren't we? What makes anyone more special than the rest of us? But. I guess... if you think about it differently - if you aren't a cocky bastard, you probably don't think you are special or can change the world, and thus you probably won't try, and if you don't try then how you will succeed?

Some could say that Alexander has a good CV, he has; a mechanical engineering degree, worked with a few NGOs and completed an Ironman. But, to him, these are just more disappointments on an ever growing list. All he remembers is that his engineering degree was not 1st class, he achieved little while with the NGOs and his friend completed the Ironman over two and a half hours  ahead of him... The standards required to be special, unknowingly reinforced by his parents, may make his expectations of life unrealistic.

Alexander is a very lucky person, which he generally fails to realise or make use of, he is white, young, wealthy and male. The world couldn't wish for a better combination, and the majority would give anything to be just one of those. Not to mention that he is also well educated, handsome and athletic, but I digress.

As most rich white boys do, Alexander thinks that he is free, and is able to explore the world at his leisure. He has yet to realise that the money and support provided by his parents, was made through blood, sweat and tears.

Alexander is a hypocrite about many things. One example is how he preaches about the loss of freedoms, climate change, inequality and poverty and demands action from others. However, he is unwilling to devote significant amounts of effort or money towards helping others solve these problems. He justifies this as the solution to an optimisation problem, where the best option is using his own time and money to solve these problems himself. This could almost make sense, if he didn't spend time watching videos, socialising and generally procrastinating.

Alexander is incredibly ignorant, he doesn't understand; drawing and painting, video and movie production, poetry and written prose, genomics, proteomics, photonics , quantum physics, astronomy, astrology, the histories of America, China, Brazil, ..., the difference between republicans and democrats, market economics, politics ... and so the list goes on. Yet he has the confidence to give opinions on many, if not all, of these topics...

Alexander thinks that he doesn't care about his image, but he fails to realise that not caring about his image, is his image. And he puts significant effort into maintaining it. He occasionally lets his hair grow long and messy, he rants about the vanity of image to anyone who will listen and he specifically avoids 'fashionable' styles.

Alexander is incredibly self-absorbed and selfish. He bases all of his decisions on what will make him happier, never doing anything thing that does not help him in some way. He largely considers his future and how he can make it better, not considering others and how they are affected.

Alexander is arrogant, deluded, lucky, pampered, hypocritical, ignorant, vain and self-absorbed.
