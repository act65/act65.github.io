## Sparse Linear Model

Want to infer the optimal actions.
This requires us to infer the payoffs.
Which actions (aka measurements) should we choose to efficiently discover the payoffs?

For linear MDPs (of the Jin type), is there also a connection to CS?
But, need the Q values to be sparse??


What is the structure of the smallest set of measurements / actions


But, CS is not adaptive. While we care about making exploration algols that
pick actions / measurements given past knowledge.
So this has applications to NMR measurements?
