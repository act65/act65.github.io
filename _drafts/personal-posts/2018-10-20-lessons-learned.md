Now that life has punched me in the face, repeatedly, I have come to realise:

a) It hurts.
b) I was not prepared.

Here is a non-comprehensive list of the things I wish I had learned at school. But didn't.

## What does our Government do?

I am not talking about learning about the high level differences between capitalism and communism or authoritarianism versus democracy, which we did cover is school. Rather, the everyday business of the various governmental departments.

When I left school, I had not heard of; MSD or IRD, or Stats, or DIA, or ... and if I had I didn't really know anything about what they did, any why we need them.

## What are my rights?

What are my rights as a New Zealand citizen? I have no idea. And that realisation surprised and scared me. It turns out some nice people fought quite hard for them, and even wrote them down.

## How do computers / the internet work?

Computers are THE greatest tool we have ever invented. And few seem to care about how to use them to their full power...

Most people interact with the internet >8 hours a day. Yet few understand it how it works.

## Well being

I heard (I can't remember where) that Yale's course on the Psychology of Well Being is one of their most popular classes. That makes sense to me, of all the valuable things one could possibly learn, learning how to be happy seems like a great lesson.

Critical thinking

It turns out people (including me) are not naturally good at being objective, or thinking clearly. People often find evidence for beliefs that they like. But that doesnt make the belief true!

What makes something true? (why) Is the truth valuable? What does it mean to behave rationally? When I left school, I had never considered these questions. 

How to empathise

It is easy to grow up in a bubble of types of person and beliefs.

Exposure to different kinds of people.

Why is it a valuable skill?
