Inspired by programming memes, I have decided to do something I've never done before. I'm going to read the docs.
Jax has a great looking [tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodidax.html). 
Let's get into it.

## A lesson in software engineering

How is Jax a lesson in good software engineering?

(key concepts: modularity, composability, ...)


## How to write good jax code?
Fast, readable, ...?

What's with this syntax?

```python
updated_array = jax_array.at[1, :].set(1.0)
```

***

> Note: It is natural to express finite difference methods as convolutions, but here we intentionally avoid convolutions in favor of array indexing/arithmetic. This is because "batch" and "feature" dimensions in TPU convolutions are padded to multiples of either 8 and 128, but in our case both these dimensions are effectively of size 1.
