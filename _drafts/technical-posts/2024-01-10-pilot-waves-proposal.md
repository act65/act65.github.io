title: Research proposal; Pilot waves
---

Main goals;
- construct a library of pilot-wave fns (plus analysis of their characteristics)
- construct a library of solutions / possible behaviours
- efficient solvers

Motivation.
- Like finding solutions to n body problems.
- Hydrodynamic analogs of pilot waves generate interesting qunatum phenomena
- 

How?
- Use large scale compute to generate potential pilot-wave equations of interest
- symbolic analysis of 
-
