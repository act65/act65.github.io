Our goal is to generate all graphs with $n$ nodes.
Let's start with a simple example, generating all graphs with 3 nodes.

![All graphs with 3 nodes.](assets/graph_enum/graphs-3.png)

But some of these graphs are the same, just drawn differently. For example, the two graphs below are the same, just drawn differently.

![Two graphs that are the same, just drawn differently.](assets/graph_enum/isomorphic.png)

This 'same'-ness is called isomorphism. We say that two graphs are isomorphic if they are the same, just drawn differently.

More formally, an isomorphism of graphs $G$ and $H$ is a bijection between the vertex sets of $G$ and $H$.

How can we avoid generating the same graph more than once? Since we dont want to waste time generating the same graph more than once.
And as $n$ gets larger, there become many ways to draw the same graph.

A naive solution is to check whether the next graph is already in the set of generated graphs. If so, discard it, else, add it to the generated set.
However, this solution requires generating and checking each graph against all the graphs generated so far. This is expensive!

A cheaper solution is; ordering the graphs and generating the graphs in order (enumeration). By generating the graphs in order, it is not possible to repeat the same graph.

#### Ordered edges

To order the graphs, we start by ordering the edges.

Each edge can be represented as a tuple of node indices, $(i, j)$. For example, the existence of the edge $(2, 3)$ indicates there is an edge between node 2 and node 3.

Given two edges, $e$, $e'$. We say that $e$ is less than $e'$ if;

$$
\begin{aligned}
e \le e': i < i' \lor (i = i' \land j < j')
\end{aligned}
$$


This can be visualised as an ordering on an adjacency matrix.

![Edges are given an order](assets/graph_enum/edge-order.png)

(an adjacency matrix is a matrix of size $n\times n$ - where n is the number of nodes. Where the $i, j$ th entry corresponds to an edge between the $i$th and $j$th node.)

#### Ordered graphs

Now that the edges have an order, we can order graphs. Each graph is ordered by asking;
given two graphs, $g, g'$, if we sort their edges (which we can do now that the edges can be ordered) and pair them up. Are the edges in $g$ always less than (or equal) to the edges in $g'$? However, this description is only intuitive.

More formally, for two graphs $g, g'$ we say that $g$ is less than $e'$ if;

$$
\begin{aligned}
&g < g':  \\
(\exists i < \text{min}(t, t')&: e_i < e_i' \land \forall j < i: e_j = e_j') \\
&\lor (t < t' \forall &j \leq t: e_j = e_j')
\end{aligned}
$$

As an example, consider the two graphs below. The first graph is smaller than the second since the edge $(2, 3)$ is smaller than $(2, 4)$.

#### Graph isomorphism

Aside: In what sense can two graphs be the 'same'?
Consider the four graphs shown below. They all have different edges, but are essentially the same graph: a graph with a 3-chain, and one disconnected node.

![Four graphs that are different, yet the 'same'.](assets/graph_enum/isomers.png)

Formally, an isomorphism of graphs $G$ and $H$ is a bijection between the vertex sets of $G$ and $H$

$$
f\colon V(G)\to V(H)
$$

such that any two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ are adjacent in $G$ if and only if $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ are adjacent in $H$.

#### Canonicity

Now that we have an order on the graphs, we can use this order to define the canonical graph (of a set of isomorphic graphs).
The canonical graph is defined to be the minimal graph. The minimal graph is defined to be the smallest graph is the set of all isomorphic graphs.

A graph, $g$ is said to be minimal if, for all permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$, $g$ is the smallest graph.

$$
\forall \pi \in S_n : g \leq g_\pi
$$

It is known that every minimal graph representative with $n$ edges has a minimal subgraph with $n-1$ edges [Read 1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016750600870325X).
This means that as we construct graphs by adding edges, we only need to pay attention to the minimal graphs, the rest can be ignored as they are not canonical.

#### The orderly enumeration algorithm

Now we are ready to describe the orderly enumeration algorithm [Meringer 2010](http://nozdr.ru/data/media/biblio/kolxoz/Ch/ChCm/Faulon%20J.L.,%20Bender%20A.%20(eds.)%20Handbook%20of%20chemoinformatics%20algorithms%20(CRC,%202010)(ISBN%201420082922)(ISBN%201420082922)(O)(435s)_ChCm_.pdf#page=246).
As noted above, we only need to generate minimal graphs, the rest are not canonical.
So, we start with the smallest graph, a graph with no edges, and proceed by adding larger edges, in order.
As we add edges, we check whether the constructed graph is minimal, if it isn't, we discard it.
This process is visualised below.

What about colored graphs (graphs with colored nodes and / or edges)?
