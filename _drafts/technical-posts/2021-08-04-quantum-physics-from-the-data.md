title: Quantum physics from the data
permalink: qm-from-data

Many approaches to physics come from 'first principles'.
Rather, I want to go back to the data and ask; what does it really tell us?


I think existing theories used to explain quantum physics are crap. They make these outraegous interpretations and justify them by saying "there doesn't exist a better model / interpretation, so just deal with it". See my post louding expressing my thoughts about; states that depend on whether you are observing them,  entanglement, ...



So, I figure, go back to the fundamentals: what does the data say? Maybe there is a better explanation.



Compton scattering



https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.21.483



tldr: Photons bounce off electrons. But the photons deflection appears to depend only on wavelength, not intensity of the light.



How does that data actually say this?!



The Stern–Gerlach experiment







The double slit experiment



tldr: A laser is pointed at two slits. Behind the slits an 'interference pattern' is formed.



The photoelectric effect







Blackbody radiation







Others!?

Ideally we would just build a test set of these experiments and allow computers to search through possible models?!?


Orbitals
Hydrogen atoms under magnification: Direct observation of the nodal structure of stark states
Stern–Gerlach experiment



Double slit experiment
Original. 

We don't care who originally did what… Only evidence!

Thomas Young 1801 demonstrates a diffraction pattern with light. (at what wavelength? At what distances? With which slit sizes?)

Question. Does wave diffraction pattern occur (with what separation) for all different wavelengths / distances / slit sizes? … We don't have that data!!!) 

If I give you a green laser (? nm), and two holes of size Xmm, located X mm apart.
Then…


Mach-Zehnder interferometer


Questions.
What if I used a circular slit?
When using light, does the light source need to be coherent? (what’s the effect of polarisation?)
Can I find any cheap electron guns?

Photo-electric effect


Compton scattering


Bell’s test

Speed of light




Notes

You know what would also be cool. A minimal set of tools / equipment that would allow you to verify these!
Include links to the raw data! Graphs and numbers!
Want all the data in an easy to use format!? Csvs!? (would be interesting to point some ML at it?)
