title: Calculating the mean
subtitle: I thought mean were simple.
---

I recently discovered that;

1. the arithmetic mean is one of many [means](#which). It is not always the 'right' mean to use.
2. there is more than one [algorithm](#algol)
for calculating the arithmetic mean. The 'usual' algorithm (sum and divide by N) is not the 'best' algorithm.
3. the mean may [not be representative](#typical) of what is 'typical'.

<!-- start with a puzzle? -->
<!-- What is the mean-ing of life? -->

Let's explore these revelations in more detail.

## Which mean should we use? And when? <a name="which"></a>

Let's start with; what is a mean? And why do we care? 

Data can be noisy, messy, and hard to interpret. We want a way to summarise the data, taking many numbers and reducing them.

A mean seeks to describe the 'center' of a dataset.
We define a dataset as a set of of $n$, $d$ dimensional real numbers, $D_n = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}: a_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

Other ways to summarise data could be by how the data is spread out (variance, standard deviation), or by the shape of the distribution (skewness, kurtosis). 

<!-- a very simple predictive model? -->
<!-- a summary of a dataset -->
<!-- the best single choice when you have to satisfy many  -->

There are many formal definitions of a mean.
Which is the 'right' definiton? Well, that depends on what you want to do with it.

The most intuitive mean would be a mean that minimises the distances between the data and the mean. 
This happens the arithmetic mean (if we choose our distance metric to be the L2 norm).
Thus, we can say that the arithmetic truly finds the 'center' of the data.

#### The arithmetic mean

$$
\mathcal A(D_n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i
$$

Properties

- the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right. The mean is the only number for which the residuals (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero. Like a set of scales with many weights on each side. Where the mean is the fulcrum.
- Translation and scale invariant. A(a+x) = A + x. A(ax) = aA.
- monotonocity. $A(a) > A(b)$ if $a > b$
- invariance under exchange. $A(a,b) = A(b,a)$

> What we are essentially saying here is: if every number in our dataset was the same number, what number would it have to be in order to have the same sum as our actual dataset?

When would we want to use this? When the elements of a combine additively.

<!-- example -->

#### The geometric mean

$$
G(a) = \bigg(\prod a_i \bigg)^{\frac{1}{N}}
$$

A physical examples of a geometric mean are;
<!-- what are multiplicative pheomenna? amplifiers? -->

If I apply 5 amplifiers, with gains, 2x, 4x, 6x, 9x, 10x,  what is the resulting gain?
It's not 2+4+6+9+10 / 5 = 6.2x. It's the geometric mean of 5.1x.

<!-- other multiplicative phenomena?
- growth rates
- ratios
-->

Properties

Equivalently, as the arithmetic mean in logscale:

$$
\exp{\left(\frac {1}{n}\sum \ln a_{i}\right)}
$$

When would we want to use this? When the elements of a combine ???-ly.

> The geometric mean can be understood in terms of geometry. The geometric mean of two numbers, a and b, is the length of one side of a square whose area is equal to the area of a rectangle with sides of lengths a and b. Similarly, the geometric mean of three numbers, a a, b b, and c c, is the length of one edge of a cube whose volume is the same as that of a cuboid with sides whose lengths are equal to the three given numbers. 

Ie we are summarising ... the data by the volume of a hypercube.
What is the volume of a hypercube with side length =mean, such that this volume is the same as the volume of a hypercube with side lengths = data?

<summary>Decathalon example</summary>
<details>
<p>Consider the decathalon. How should we average the scores across the 10 events?</p>

Currently we use an arithmetic mean to calculate the overall score. But maybe it makes more sense to use the geometric mean.
Getting a score of 0 in one event will result in a 0 overall score. This is because the geometric mean is multiplicative. Thus the geometric mean rewards decathletes who are consistently good across all events.

#### The harmonic mean

$$
H(a) = \bigg( \frac{\sum a_i^{-1}}{n} \bigg)^{-1}
$$

> it tends (compared to the arithmetic mean) to mitigate the impact of large outliers and aggravate the impact of small ones.

use case: rates. average speed.

Why dont we use other equations?

$$
J(a) = \sqrt{\sum a_i^2} \\
$$

## The 'best' algorithm for calculating the arithmetic mean <a name="algol"></a>

Let's dig deeper into calculating the arithmetic mean. 
What do we mean by 'best'?

We could define best by;
- accuracy (how close is the estimate to the true mean)
- robustness (how much does the estimate change with the addition of a new sample)
- efficiency (how long does it take to calculate the estimate)

Let's use the most accurate.

### Robust algorithms for calculating averages

As argued above, the mean is not robust to outliers.

Mean of medians. vs median of means.

Near-optimal mean estimators with respect to general norms

What about online mean estimation? How to use mean of medians?

What about a tree of medians? Say n = 3. Then take the median of the first 3 numbers and add that as a parent and forget the original 3.

## 'Typical' samples<a name="typical"></a>

Consider a bi-modal distribution.
With (sharp) modes at -x and x. The mean is 0. But, we would never see a sample at 0.

Stranger than this example is a high dimensional Gaussian distribution, with mean $\mu$ and covariance $\sigma I$. As n increases, the samples concentrate on a thin shell around the surface of a hypersphere. This hypersphere has radius $\sqrt{n} \sigma$.
Thus the samples are a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ away from the mean.
