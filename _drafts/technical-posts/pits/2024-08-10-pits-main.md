Inverse problems are a class of problems where we want to find the input to a function given the output. For example, 

We consider the setting where we have access to a prior $p(x)$ and likelihood function $p(y \mid x)$. We observe $y$ and want to recover $x$. 

Using Bayes rule, we can write the posterior as;

$$
\begin{align*}
p(x | y) &= \frac{p(y | x) p(x)}{p(y)} \tag{Bayes rule} \\
x^* &= \arg \max_x p(x | y) \tag{the MAP solution}
\end{align*}
$$

> MAP will return the most likely value of $x$, given $y$.
However, is the most likely value of $x$ the 'best' guess of $x$?

We offer an alternative approach, suggesting that our guess of $x$ should be typical. This frames the inverse problem as a problem of projection into the typical set (PITS).

$$
\begin{align*}
x^* &= \arg \max_{x \in \mathcal T(p(x))_\epsilon} p(y | x) \tag{PITS}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathcal T(p(x))_\epsilon$ is the $\epsilon$-typical set of $p(x)$.

We provide a few posts to help you understand PITS;

1. Background on typicality and high dimensional Gaussians [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/pits/typical)
2. MAP produces solutions that are not typical. [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/pits/map)
3. (WIP) A method to apply PITS arbitrary distributions using neural flows. [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/pits/flow)
5. (WIP) Theory showing that in the Gaussian case, PITS combined with flows is principled. [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/pits/flow-theory) 
4. (WIP) A demonstration of the PITS approach to inverse problems applied to neural flows. [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/pits/mnist-demo)

The advantages of this approach are;

- we have a way to control the quality (/typicality) of the solution. (missing from posterior sampling formulations)
