Here we train a neural flow on the MNIST dataset and use it to solve an inverse problem.

![MNIST]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pits/latent-potsv3_gaussian.png)

## Details

We use the ?? fomulation of stochastic interpolants.

We train a latent flow using a pretrained autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.
(this solves the dimensionality / variance problems described in [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}/si-in-practice/).)

TODO benchmark against MAP, and other posterior sampling methods. (on larger datasets)
