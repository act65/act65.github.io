Within machine learning, automatic differentiation proves its awesome utility.

However, as far as I know, there is no analog for automatic integration.
Why not?

The key to automatic differentiation is the chain rule.
It allows us to compute the derivative of a function by breaking it down into a sequence of elementary operations.
Calculating their derivatives independently, we can then combine them to get the derivative of the original function.
