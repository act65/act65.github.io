The first fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of a function is the antiderivative of that function.

Let f be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval [a, b]. Let F be the function defined, for all x in [a, b], by F ( x ) = ∫ a x f ( t ) d t . {\displaystyle F(x)=\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\,dt.}

Then F is uniformly continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and F ′ ( x ) = f ( x ) {\displaystyle F'(x)=f(x)} for all x in (a, b) so F is an antiderivative of f. 


<!-- The second fundamental theorem says that the sum of infinitesimal changes in a quantity (the integral of the derivative of the quantity) adds up to the net change in the quantity. -->

## Limits

__Definition__: Suppose f(x) is defined for all x in an interval about a (possibly excluding a).

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to a}f(x)=ℓ
\end{align}
$$

<!-- TODO some fun examples of convergent series? -->

interpretations / defitions? 
- for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - ℓ| < \epsilon$ whenever $0 < |x - a| < \delta$.
- $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close to $ℓ$ by making $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ (but not equal to $a$).

<!-- what's a physical example of this? -->

For example;

If I toss a fair coin N times, what is the probability p(N) that I have not yet tossed a head?

$$
\begin{align}
p(N) &= (1 - \frac{1}{2})^N \\
\lim_{N \to \infty} p(N) &= 0
\end{align}
$$

## Derivatives

__Definition__: The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x=a$ is defined as

$$
\begin{align}
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
\end{align}
$$

## Maxima and minima

__Definition__: A function $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x=a$ if $f(a) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in some open interval containing $a$.

__Definition__: A function $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x=a$ if $f(a) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in some open interval containing $a$.

__Definition__: A function $f(x)$ has a global maximum at $x=a$ if $f(a) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

__Definition__: A function $f(x)$ has a global minimum at $x=a$ if $f(a) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

## Integrals

__Definition__: The integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is defined as

$$
\begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \Delta x
\end{align}
$$

where $x_i^*$ is any point in the $i$ th subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ and $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$.

## Fundamental theorem of calculus

__Theorem__: If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $[a,b]$, then

$$
\begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
\end{align}
$$

<!-- The Whole Change as Sum of Partial Changes -->

## 

## One variable at a time

__Theorem__: If $f(x,y)$ is continuous on a rectangle $R$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ on $R$, then

$$
\begin{align}
\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dy dx = \int_a^b F(x,d) - F(x,c) dx
\end{align}
$$


Definitions;

- 
- anti derivative: $F'(x) = f(x)$
- integral: $\int_a^b f(x) dx$
- indefinite integral: $\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C$
- definite integral: $\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$

Mean Value Theorem: If f is a function that is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b), then there is a point c between a and b such that f′(c)=f(b)−f(a)b−a.
