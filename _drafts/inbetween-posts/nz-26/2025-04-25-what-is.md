# Part 1: What Is? 
## Aotearoa's Balance Sheet – Strengths & Strains

Aotearoa New Zealand often projects an image of pristine landscapes and a high quality of life. While there's truth in this, a deeper look reveals a nation grappling with complex challenges alongside its successes. This first part of our series aims to present a balanced, evidence-based view of where we stand – what's broadly working, and where significant strains and systemic issues demand urgent attention. A recurring theme we'll explore is how often "what's not working" can be traced back to deeply embedded, misaligned incentives within our systems.

**What's Broadly Working? (Acknowledging Our Strengths)**

It's important to start by acknowledging areas where New Zealand demonstrates resilience and positive attributes:

*   **Democratic Foundations:** We have a stable parliamentary democracy with a history of free and fair elections and peaceful transfers of power. Our Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system is designed for broad representation. [General Democratic Principles]()
*   **Relative Peace and Safety:** Compared to many parts of the world, New Zealand enjoys high levels of peace and personal safety, though challenges exist.
*   **Natural Beauty and Environmental Ethos (Aspirations vs. Reality):** Our stunning natural environment is a core part of our identity and economy. There's a strong public desire for environmental protection, even if, as we'll see, our outcomes don't always match our aspirations.
*   **Social Capital (with caveats):** Historically, New Zealand has benefited from relatively high levels of social trust and community engagement, though recent trends suggest these may be under pressure. [Koi Tū Social Cohesion]()
*   **Commitment to Global Norms (in principle):** We are active participants in international forums and generally align ourselves with international law and human rights principles, as seen with our refugee resettlement quota (1,500 annually, largely met post-COVID). [Refugee Quota Data]()

**What's Not Working? Strains, Suboptimal Systems, and Misaligned Incentives**

This is where we need to be unflinchingly honest. Many of the challenges we face are not isolated incidents but symptoms of deeper systemic issues, often fueled by incentives that don't align with public good or long-term wellbeing.

1.  **The Well-being Deficit: Poverty, Homelessness, and Mental Health in a Wealthy Nation**
    *   Despite our overall wealth, significant portions of our population are left behind. In the year to June 2023, 17.5% of children (1 in 6) lived in poverty after housing costs. Material hardship affected 10.3% of children, with stark disparities for Māori and Pasifika tamariki. [Child Poverty Stats NZ 2023]()
    *   Homelessness remains a critical issue. As of March 2024, over 24,500 applicants were on the public housing register, and thousands were in emergency housing. Broader estimates (from 2018) suggested over 100,000 experienced severe housing deprivation. [HUD Housing Dashboard, Otago Homelessness 2018]()
    *   Mental health services are under strain, with growing demand. (We would need to search for specific data on mental health prevalence/service access if you want to make this a core point).

2.  **Crumbling Foundations: Decaying Infrastructure & The Challenge of Long-Term Political Thinking**
    *   Our essential infrastructure is aging and underfunded. The water infrastructure deficit alone is estimated at $120-$185 billion over 30 years. [Water Infrastructure Deficit]() Similar stories of backlogs and investment needs plague transport, digital government systems, and school buildings. [Transport, Digital, School Infrastructure Data]()
    *   This points to a broader challenge: **a lack of consistent, long-term political thinking and investment.** Short electoral cycles can incentivize focus on immediate issues over decades-long infrastructure planning or preventative spending. The "Use It or Lose It" approach in government procurement, for example, can encourage wasteful year-end spending rather than long-term efficiency. [Misaligned Incentive Example]()

3.  **Vulnerabilities in Our Political & Economic Systems: Influence, Incentives, and Inequality**
    *   **Opaque Influence:** Our political system has loopholes. The lack of a regulated lobbying register and high thresholds for donation disclosure mean private and corporate interests can exert influence away from public scrutiny. [Lobbying Regulations, Donation Thresholds]()
    *   **Misaligned Economic Incentives:**
        *   **Externalities:** Many industries generate significant environmental and social costs that are not paid by them – from carbon emissions (agriculture largely unpriced by the ETS) to air pollution (costing billions in health impacts) to the potential social costs of digital platforms. [ETS Gaps, Air Pollution Costs]() This is a market failure where the incentive to pollute or cause harm is not adequately countered.
        *   **Healthcare:** Fee-for-service models can incentivize procedure volume over patient outcomes. Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers may gain larger rebates for higher-priced drugs, influencing formularies. [Healthcare Misaligned Incentives]()
        *   **Financial Services:** Credit rating agencies paid by issuers, asset managers paid by percentage-of-assets regardless of performance, and mortgage originators compensated at closing without long-term risk all represent incentives that don't always align with client best interests or systemic stability, as seen in past financial crises. [Financial Services Misaligned Incentives]()
        *   **Innovation Lag:** NZ struggles to translate good innovation "inputs" into commercial "outputs," ranking 25th in the 2024 Global Innovation Index. This suggests systemic issues in how we foster and commercialise new ideas. [GII 2024]()
    *   **Deep-Seated Inequality:** Wealth remains highly concentrated (top 10% hold 51%), and the wealthiest pay a much lower effective tax rate (8.9%) on their full economic income than average New Zealanders (~20%), largely due to untaxed capital gains. [Wealth Concentration, IRD Tax Report]() This systemic feature of the tax system perpetuates inequality.
    *   **The Rule of Law – Applied Unequally?:** Stark disparities in the justice system, particularly the over-representation of Māori in prison (over 50% of prisoners vs. ~17% of population), raise profound questions about equal application of the law. [Māori Incarceration Rates]() While agencies pursue corporate crime, questions about resourcing and the ability of wealthy entities to navigate or mitigate legal consequences persist. [SFO Data, AML Weaknesses]()

4.  **Suboptimal Government Operations: Beyond Consultants**
    *   While cutting consultant spending is a visible target, deeper inefficiencies and misaligned incentives exist within public sector operations. The previously mentioned "Use It or Lose It" budgeting is one example. Defence contractor cost-plus awards can incentivize cost inflation. Political campaign consultants paid a percentage of media spending may prioritize expensive advertising over other forms of engagement. [Public Sector & Campaign Misaligned Incentives]()
    *   The challenge of **regulatory agility** is also key. Responding effectively to emerging monopolies (e.g., grocery sector) or new societal challenges (e.g., digital platform regulation) often involves lengthy processes, and it's debatable whether our systems are nimble enough. [Grocery Market Study, Digital Regulation]()

5.  **A Fractured Shared Reality? Discourse and Division**
    *   In an era of information overload, shaping a shared, evidence-based understanding of reality is increasingly difficult. 65% of New Zealanders are concerned about fake news, and many report regular exposure to misinformation. [JMAD Trust Report 2024]()
    *   This contributes to increasing "affective political polarization" – a growing dislike and distrust between people with different political views, even if differences on specific policies are not always extreme. [VUW Partisanship Study]() This makes finding common ground and addressing complex national challenges even harder.

**Conclusion to Part 1: A Call for Systemic Honesty**

Aotearoa New Zealand is not broken, but it faces clear and significant strains. Many of these are not just isolated problems but are interwoven with the very design of our systems and the incentives they create. From the visible decay of infrastructure to the less visible, but equally corrosive, impacts of inequality and misaligned incentives, the evidence calls for a clear-eyed assessment.

Recognising these challenges honestly is the first step. In Part 2, we will turn to the crucial question of "What should be?" – outlining a vision for a New Zealand that more fully lives up to its potential and the aspirations of its people.

TODO

Much of what we disagree about is measureable in pinciple.

"Data Missing/Collectable in Principle":

    Ideal 3 (Rule of Law - Disparities): Detailed analysis of conviction rates for specific offences, controlled for prior history/offence severity, then disaggregated by ethnicity AND detailed socio-economic indicators. (Collectable via IDI research). Analysis of sentencing remarks/case files for patterns (potential LLM application in research).

    Ideal 3 (Rule of Law - Corporate Avoidance): Systematic analysis of penalties for corporate crimes vs. economic harm. Tracking regulatory capture. Analysis of corporate litigation patterns to delay/avoid penalties. (Complex research; some aspects potentially aided by LLM analysis of case law).

    Ideal 4 (Regulated Market - Externalised Costs): Systematic, national-level framework for estimating and reporting key environmental/social externalities by industry (environmental-economic accounting). (Major research/statistical development).

    Ideal 4 (Regulated Market - Agility): Framework for retrospectively assessing regulatory agility. Comparative international studies of regulatory responses. (Research endeavour).

    Ideal 8 (Robust Discourse - Policy Literacy): Regular, representative surveys assessing public understanding of key current policies. (Survey research).

    Ideal 8 (Robust Discourse - Engagement): More systematic, cross-government collation/analysis of participation rates in public consultations, including demographics. Qualitative research into engagement experiences. (Government data consolidation & research).
