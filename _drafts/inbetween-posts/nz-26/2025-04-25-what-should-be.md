## Part 2: What Should Be? A Vision for Aotearoa New Zealand

**Introduction: From Diagnosis to Aspiration**

In Part 1, we took an honest look at the current state of Aotearoa New Zealand – a nation of strengths but also significant strains and systemic challenges. Now, we shift from diagnosis to aspiration. If we are to navigate the complexities of the 21st century and build a truly thriving society, what should we be aiming for? What principles and ideals should guide us?

This section outlines a vision for "What Should Be." It's not a definitive blueprint, as the specifics of "how" are for collective, expert-driven effort. Rather, it's a set of guiding stars – ideals that, if achieved, could create a more equitable, sustainable, and flourishing Aotearoa for all. For each ideal, we'll also consider how we might measure progress, moving beyond vague hopes to tangible markers.

**Our Guiding Ideals for Aotearoa**

1.  **Genuine Equality of Opportunity:**
    *   **The Vision:** A society where every individual's potential to flourish and contribute is nurtured from the start, and their life path is determined by their talents and efforts, not by the circumstances of their birth – their socio-economic background, ethnicity, gender, or location. This means equitable access to world-class education, financial tools for entrepreneurship, and robust support systems that mitigate life's inevitable challenges like ill-health, violence, or discrimination.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Intergenerational Income Mobility:** A significantly weaker link between parental income and a child's future earnings, with equal mobility prospects for all ethnic groups. (Current: "Moderate to high" mobility, but parental income still significant, with disparities for Māori and Pasifika).
        *   **Educational Equity:** Minimal gaps in NCEA Level 2 (and higher) achievement rates between different ethnic and socio-economic groups, with all groups achieving at high levels (e.g., >90%). (Current: Significant gaps, e.g., 30+ percentage point disparity between Māori/Pasifika and Asian students for NCEA L2).
        *   **Access to Early Childhood Education (ECE):** Universal participation in high-quality ECE, eliminating current ethnic and socio-economic disparities. (Current: ~92% overall prior ECE, but lower for Māori/Pasifika children).

2.  **Shaping and Sharing a Common Reality: Truth, Trust, and Media's Role**
    *   **The Vision:** A society where public discourse is grounded in verifiable facts and respectful dialogue, where citizens can readily distinguish credible information from manipulation, and where media institutions see their primary role as fostering understanding and enabling informed participation in democracy, rather than chasing clicks or fueling division. We value science, critical thinking, and the ability to collectively make sense of complex issues.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Reduced Impact of Misinformation:** Minimal circulation and impact of harmful misinformation/disinformation, with high public resilience. (Current: 65% concerned about fake news, significant exposure reported).
        *   **Lowered Political Polarization:** Reduced affective polarization (dislike/distrust of opposing partisans), fostering a political environment where respectful debate and common ground are valued. (Current: Affective polarization increasing).
        *   **Media Prioritising Public Value:** Media consistently prioritising accuracy, fairness, balance, and depth over sensationalism, with clear distinctions between news and opinion. (Current: Public concerns about sensationalism and bias exist).

3.  **The Rule of Law: Applied Equally and Justly to All**
    *   **The Vision:** A system of governance where all individuals, institutions, and entities – regardless of wealth, power, or status – are equally accountable to laws that are publicly known, fairly enforced, and independently adjudicated. Justice is not only done but is seen to be done by all communities.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Elimination of Justice System Disparities:** No significant disparity in justice system outcomes (arrests, charges, convictions, incarceration) by ethnicity or socio-economic status, when controlling for actual rates of offending. (Current: Stark over-representation of Māori in prisons and adverse outcomes).
        *   **Accountability for Corporate & "White-Collar" Crime:** Robust, well-resourced investigation and prosecution of corporate and financial crime, with penalties acting as effective deterrents. No perception or reality that wealth or influence can shield perpetrators. (Current: Questions about resourcing and effectiveness in tackling complex corporate malfeasance and AML weaknesses).

4.  **A Thriving, Fair Market within a Sustainable World: Smart Regulation for Shared Prosperity**
    *   **The Vision:** An economy characterized by genuine free-market competition and innovation, carefully and agilely regulated by a powerful, socially and environmentally conscious government. This government ensures that market activities serve the broader public good, that externalised costs (like pollution or social harm) are minimised and internalised, and that consumers are robustly protected.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Meeting Climate Goals & Internalising Environmental Costs:** Consistent progress towards ambitious emissions reduction targets, with mechanisms like a comprehensive ETS effectively pricing externalities across all sectors, including agriculture. Significant reduction in air and water pollution, with polluters bearing the costs. (Current: Not on track for 2030 climate targets; significant unpriced agricultural emissions; billions in social costs from air pollution).
        *   **Effective Consumer Protection & Reduced Harm:** Low incidence of consumer harm, with consumers well-informed and able to access easy redress. Minimal financial loss from scams and unfair practices. (Current: High proportion of consumers experience problems; significant financial losses).
        *   **Agile and Effective Regulation:** Government and regulatory agencies quickly identify and respond to market failures, emerging monopolies, or negative externalities with timely and proportionate action. (Current: Responses vary in speed and comprehensiveness, challenges with novel issues).

5.  **Fair Limits on Extreme Wealth: Ensuring Resources Serve All**
    *   **The Vision:** A society that recognises the value of enterprise and innovation but also understands that an unlimited accumulation of wealth by a few individuals is detrimental to social cohesion and democratic fairness. This might involve mechanisms like a very high marginal tax rate on wealth accumulated beyond a democratically agreed (and inflation-adjusted) threshold (e.g., $1 billion), ensuring surplus resources are redirected for broader societal benefit.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Reduced Wealth Concentration:** A significant decrease in the share of wealth held by the top 1% and 10%. (Current: Top 10% hold 51% of household net worth).
        *   **Fairer Taxation of Wealth:** The wealthiest individuals and families contribute a significantly higher effective tax rate on their full economic income, reflecting greater progressivity. (Current: Wealthiest pay ~8.9% effective tax rate on economic income vs. ~20% for middle wealth).

6.  **Universal Basic Needs Met: Dignity and Security for Every New Zealander**
    *   **The Vision:** A foundational commitment that no person in Aotearoa should be without the essentials for a dignified life. This means ensuring everyone has access to safe and secure housing, sufficient nutritious food, quality healthcare, necessary utilities (including internet access), and a baseline economic security that prevents destitution.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Eradication of Child Poverty:** Child poverty rates (especially AHC income poverty and material hardship) reduced to minimal levels, meeting and exceeding current legislated targets, with no ethnic disparities. (Current: 17.5% AHC poverty, 10.3% material hardship, with higher rates for Māori/Pasifika).
        *   **Solving Homelessness & Ensuring Housing Affordability:** Homelessness is rare, brief, and non-recurring. Housing is affordable for all, with households spending no more than 30% of income on housing. (Current: Severe housing unaffordability; tens of thousands on housing waitlists/in emergency housing).

7.  **Long-Term Political Thinking & Governance: Stewardship for Future Generations**
    *   **The Vision:** A political and governance culture where decision-making consistently prioritizes the long-term wellbeing of current and future generations and the enduring health of our social, economic, and environmental systems, over short-term political expediency. This involves embedding foresight, evidence-based policy, and intergenerational equity into the heart of government.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Effective Long-Term Institutions & Frameworks:** Well-resourced, independent bodies focused on long-term issues (e.g., Climate Change Commission, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment) have significant influence. Long-term fiscal and wellbeing frameworks genuinely drive budget and policy.
        *   **Cross-Party Action on Critical Issues:** Evidence of enduring cross-party consensus and policy continuity on fundamental long-term challenges like climate adaptation, infrastructure planning, and superannuation.
        *   **Reduced Focus on Short-Term Cycles:** Political discourse and policy development demonstrably address 30-year challenges rather than being solely dominated by 3-year electoral cycles.

8.  **Aotearoa as a Responsible Global Citizen: Principled International Cooperation**
    *   **The Vision:** New Zealand actively and consistently acts as a principled and constructive member of the international community. We uphold international law and human rights, contribute our fair share to addressing global challenges like climate change and poverty, foster sustainable international partnerships, and offer refuge and humanitarian assistance generously.
    *   **Measuring Progress (Examples):**
        *   **Meeting International Aid Commitments:** Official Development Assistance (ODA) consistently meets or exceeds the UN target of 0.7% of GNI. (Current: 0.28% of GNI).
        *   **Generous Refugee Resettlement:** A significantly increased refugee resettlement quota, reflecting a greater per capita commitment, alongside fair and efficient asylum processes. (Current: 1,500 quota, largely met).

**Conclusion to Part 2: A North Star for Action**

These ideals, taken together, paint a picture of an Aotearoa that is more equitable, sustainable, resilient, and just. They offer a "North Star" to guide our collective efforts. Achieving them requires not just good intentions, but a fundamental shift in how we think, how our systems operate, and how we prioritise.

The crucial next question, then, is "How do we get there?" Part 3 will explore this, not by offering definitive policy prescriptions, but by considering the *process* and the *mindset* required for transformative change.
