## Measuring What Matters: Are We Solving the Right Problems?

We live in a world of finite resources. Every dollar spent on one problem is a dollar not spent on another. This forces us to ask a difficult question: how do we decide what to fix? To answer that, we first need to measure the problems.

For decades, the gold standard for measuring the global burden of disease has been the **Disability-Adjusted Life Year**, or DALY.

### The DALY: A Powerful Tool for Health

A DALY is a unit that represents the loss of one year of "full health." It's a clever way to combine the years of life lost to premature death with the years lived with a disability. For example:

*   A person who dies 30 years before their life expectancy has lost 30 DALYs.
*   A person who lives for 10 years with a condition that has a 50% disability weight (like severe depression) has lost 5 DALYs (10 years * 0.5 disability).

This allows organizations like the WHO to compare the burden of vastly different conditions. It's a powerful tool for prioritizing health funding.

### The Blind Spot: You Can Be Healthy in a Cage

But here's the catch: DALYs only measure health.

Imagine a person who is in perfect physical health—no diseases, no disabilities. Now, imagine they are locked in a solitary confinement cell. They have zero DALYs lost, but would anyone describe their life as having a high quality?

This is the blind spot of purely health-based metrics. They cannot capture the profound human suffering that comes from the loss of freedom. A life without agency, without choice, without the ability to move, speak, or work freely is a life of immense deprivation, regardless of one's physical condition.

To measure this, we need a different tool.

### Quantifying Freedom: The Human Freedom Index

The Human Freedom Index (HFI), a joint project of the Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute, is the most comprehensive attempt to measure this other dimension of life.[^1] It scores countries on a scale of 0-10 by combining 86 distinct indicators of personal, civil, and economic freedom.

The results paint a familiar picture. In the 2024 report:
*   **Top-ranked:** Switzerland (9.14), New Zealand (9.08), Denmark (9.04)
*   **Bottom-ranked:** Yemen (3.78), Myanmar (3.97), Iran (3.96), and at the very bottom, Syria (3.10).

This gives us a framework for quantifying the *formal* and *effective* freedoms a person has.

### A New Metric: The "Freedom-Year Lost" (FYL)

Inspired by the DALY, we can create a new metric: the **Freedom-Year Lost (FYL)**.

The logic is simple. If a perfectly free life is a 10 on the HFI scale, then any score below 10 represents a loss.

*   **Freedom Loss per Person** = `(10 - HFI Score) / 10`
*   **Total FYLs** = `Affected Population * Freedom Loss per Person`

This gives us a number, like DALYs, representing the total "full-freedom life-years" lost to a specific situation annually.

### The Calculation: A Crisis vs. A Disease

Let's apply this framework to two major global challenges to see where our "solution-oriented" funding goes. We will only look at funding aimed at *solving* the root problem, not just managing the symptoms.

**Case Study 1: The Rohingya in Cox's Bazar**

Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh is the world's largest refugee camp, home to nearly one million stateless Rohingya people who fled a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. They cannot leave, cannot legally work, and have no formal access to justice.

To estimate their freedom score, we start with Bangladesh's HFI score (5.52) and adjust it based on the reality of camp life. The result is a catastrophic loss of freedom.

| HFI Category | Baseline (Bangladesh) | Estimate (Rohingya Refugee) | Justification for Estimate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Personal Freedom** | **5.29** | **~2.5** | |
| Rule of Law | ~4.5 | **1.0** | As stateless persons, they have no formal access to the national justice system and are subject to camp-specific, often arbitrary, governance. |
| Security and Safety | ~7.0 | **2.0** | Camps are known to be dangerous, with high rates of crime, violence, and vulnerability to exploitation. Security is not guaranteed. |
| Movement | ~6.0 | **0.0** | This is the most severe restriction. They are not permitted to leave the camps. Freedom of movement is effectively zero. |
| **Economic Freedom** | **5.85** | **~0.5** | |
| Legal System & Property Rights | ~4.8 | **0.5** | They cannot legally own property or land. Contracts are unenforceable in the formal legal system. |
| Freedom to Trade | ~7.2 | **0.0** | They cannot legally engage in international or even national trade. |
| Regulation (of business/labor) | ~6.1 | **1.0** | They are barred from legally starting a business, seeking formal employment, or accessing credit. |

This back-of-the-envelope calculation puts their HFI score at **1.5 out of 10**—a score less than half that of a citizen living in Syria, the lowest-ranked country in the world.

*   **Burden:** 1,000,000 people * ((10 - 1.5) / 10) = **850,000 FYLs**

What is the "solution" funding? Not the hundreds of millions in humanitarian aid ($545.4 million [^7]) which simply keeps the status-quo, but the money for legal action, diplomacy, and resettlement. This is generously estimated at around **$30 million annually**.

### **Breaking Down the "Solution" Funding for the Rohingya Crisis (~$30 Million)**

This funding is aimed at permanently resolving the crisis, not 'just' providing life support. It's a composite of three main areas:

*   **Legal Action (~$5 Million/year):** The most prominent effort is The Gambia's case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Myanmar of genocide. This is a direct attempt to create legal accountability and a framework for a safe return. Such international legal cases are incredibly expensive, involving teams of lawyers, expert testimony, and years of work. The case is funded by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which has been fundraising for it since 2019.[^3] While the precise annual budget isn't public, a conservative estimate of **$5 million per year** for ongoing legal costs is a reasonable figure for a case of this magnitude.

*   **Diplomacy & Advocacy (~$5 Million/year):** This is the most difficult category to quantify. It includes the work of UN Special Envoys, the diplomatic time of various governments pressuring Myanmar, and the targeted advocacy of NGOs like Human Rights Watch, Fortify Rights, and Amnesty International. These groups work to document abuses, lobby governments, and keep the political pressure on for a resolution that includes citizenship for the Rohingya. This is distinct from their humanitarian work. If we conservatively estimate the dedicated advocacy budgets of a dozen major NGOs and the operational costs of relevant UN diplomatic roles, a figure of **$5 million annually** is a plausible, if rough, estimate.

*   **Resettlement (~$20 Million/year):** This is a tangible, though small-scale, solution. In 2023, the United States began a significant resettlement program, accepting over 1,000 Rohingya refugees from the camps in Bangladesh.[^4] The cost of resettling a refugee in the U.S. for the first year is estimated to be at least $20,000 per person.[^5] This represents a direct "solution" expenditure of approximately **$20 million**. While this is a crucial step, it's important to note it addresses only about 0.1% of the camp's population per year.


**Case Study 2: Type 2 Diabetes**

The International Diabetes Federation estimates 537 million adults live with diabetes.[^2] Using a conservative DALY weight of 0.06 (a 6% loss of perfect health), the global burden is immense.

*   **Burden:** 537,000,000 people * 0.06 DALYs/person = **32,220,000 DALYs**

Of course. You're right to push for the details on those estimates. A back-of-the-envelope calculation is only as good as the assumptions and data that go into it.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of how the "solution-oriented" funding estimates were derived.

### **Breaking Down the "Solution" Funding for Type 2 Diabetes (~$3 Billion)**

This funding is focused on R&D for a cure, prevention, or reversal of the disease, not the much larger cost of ongoing care.

*   **Government Research (~$1.2 Billion+):** The largest single funder is the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). In fiscal year 2023, the NIH's estimated budget for diabetes research was **$1.15 billion**.[^6] Other governments (in the EU, UK, China, etc.) also have significant public research funding streams.

*   **Pharmaceutical Industry R&D (~$1.5 Billion+):** This is a massive driver of research. While exact figures are proprietary, we know that the top three diabetes drug companies alone—Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, and Sanofi—collectively spend over $20 billion on R&D annually across all diseases. Given that diabetes treatments are a cornerstone of their business, it is very conservative to assume that at least **$1.5 billion** of this is dedicated to developing next-generation diabetes drugs, including potential cures and preventative therapies.

*   **Non-Profit & Charitable Research (~$300 Million+):** Major non-profits are significant funders. JDRF (which also funds Type 2 research) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) together invest hundreds of millions of dollars globally in research grants each year.

Adding these conservative estimates together ($1.2B + $1.5B + $0.3B) brings the total global "solution-oriented" funding for diabetes comfortably into the **$3 billion** range annually.

### The Bottom Line: Where Does the "Solution" Money Go?

Let's put it all in a table.

| Problem | Total Annual Burden | Type of Funding | Est. Annual "Solution" Funding | **Funding per Unit of Burden (Solution-Oriented)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rohingya Crisis** | 850,000 FYLs | Legal, Advocacy, Resettlement | ~$30 Million | **$35.29** |
| **Type 2 Diabetes** | 32,220,000 DALYs | Research & Development | ~$3 Billion | **$93.11** |

### The Great Imbalance: What Our Spending Reveals

This refined calculation completely inverts our initial assumption and reveals a much deeper truth.

When we only consider funding aimed at *solving* the root cause of the problem, the world invests nearly **three times more** per unit of suffering to cure diabetes than it does to resolve the political crisis of the Rohingya.

I believe there's bias in how we allocate resources to solve the world's problems. The discrepancy isn't random; it points to three powerful factors:

1.  **Tractability and Perceived ROI:** We invest in problems that seem "solvable" with technology and capital. Medical research, while difficult, has a clear path and a robust industry. A political crisis like the Rohingya's statelessness is seen as intractable, with no clear "solution" to fund.

2.  **The "Recipient" Problem:** It is easy to write a check to a university lab or a pharmaceutical company to research a disease. It is impossible to give money to a single entity to "solve" the Rohingya's statelessness. The solution requires political will from Myanmar, which cannot be purchased.

3.  **The Power of Constituency:** Diabetes affects millions of people in the world's wealthiest countries, creating a powerful political and economic constituency that demands research funding. The Rohingya are a stateless, impoverished minority with no powerful state actor advocating for their political rights.

The world is willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year to *manage* the Rohingya crisis—to keep people alive in a state of profound unfreedom. But it invests a pittance in the hard, political work required to restore that freedom.

Metrics like DALYs are invaluable, but they don't tell the whole story. By expanding our view to include the burden of lost freedom, we get a clearer, and often more horrifying, picture of the world's priorities.
