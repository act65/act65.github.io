> "Why did (our) intelligence emerge from electrical signals, motion control and sensing? Why not from the immune system?"

Questions:
- What kind of environment would select for an intelligent immune system?
- How might this immune system be structured? Is it centralized like a brain, or distributed throughout the body?
- How would their intelligence differ from ours? (would they be better at certain kinds of problems?)
- What would their values be? (would they be more or less altruistic?)

## Environment

To what extent did the evolutionary pressures for efficient movement, robust sensing, and rapid neural processing contribute to the emergence of our intelligence?
What if there were different pressures? Meaner infections, plenty of food if you know how to transform it, 

<!-- this is like mechanism design?
which env incentivises which genes / traits? -->

If food is scarce (because it's distributed in space) then we need motion control and sensing to find it.
If food comes to you (in the form of other life; infections, paracites, family, ...) then you need an immune system to kill it and eat it.

## How might this immune system be structured?

<!-- Want a path from simple immune system to 'intelligence' -->

Advantaegous traits:
- Extremely flexible metabolism. Allowing them to break down and use a wide variety of chemicals.
- Extremely flexible synthesis. Allowing them to produce a wide variety of chemicals. (how do they store this knowledge? and how did they aquire it?)
- chemical chimera. They can appear to be other species (by producing the same chemicals) and thus avoid or encourage interactions with other species.
- 

Evolution
- How could memory, in the form of memory cells, evlove into something smarter? Something that can generalize from past experiences? A network of memory cells?
-  

> Part of the problem is generalisation is very dangerous in the immune system.



## Differences from our intelligence

Are the planning problems they solve different from ours?

- planning a synthesis pathway vs planning a route through space

Are the memory problems they solve different from ours?

- remembering a synthesis pathway vs remembering a route through space

## Background

How does the immune system work?
- memory! stores information about past infections
- pattern matching! recognizes pathogens
- 

Biological prescedent for intelligent immune systems

- behavioral fever
- immunological synapse
