I want to explore how people are bad at noticing extreme risks.
We use familirarity to gauge risk (rather than an actual risk assesment) and fail to recognise the subtle differences that make it dangerous.

For example;

- cycling in winter. You've cycled to work a hundred times. Today's a beautiful, cold, sunny day. ... black ice. Crash and die.
- drugs with friends. You've done Moly a hundred times. Though you didn't notice it at the time, you were never the first to take Moly and it was always from from a trusted source (being a known drug dealer whom your friends have dealt with before). ... this time, different dealer, you're the first, laced w fentanyl. OD and dead.
- Dota 2. Your team mate was just farming there 30s ago and now the camps have respawned. So you go to farm it. However, no opponents have shown on the map for the last 30s. Also, you don't have buy back. You die and it's GG.
- (I assume there is some chess position with; with to mate in 3. but if you move a single pawn one space then it's black to mate in x.)
- (maybe a dating example? turned serial killer?)

Over-generalising!?

Small details can matter!
