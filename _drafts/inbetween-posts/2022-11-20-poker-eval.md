title: Why does poker have many rounds?

Imagine that the [World series of Poker](https://www.wsop.com/) (with potential winnings of >$12 million) only had 1 round. 
You have paid the $10,000 entry and are dealt 2 clubs and 7 spades (the worst hand possible).

<!-- make pic of dealt hands and flop -->

Many would consider this to be an unfair game. It relies too much on chance.
Whom ever was dealt a good has an advantage.

Instead, the game is played over many rounds.
But how many rounds should be played?
<!-- Are tournaments the best way to eval? -->
The answer to this question depends on the chance we are willing to take that the best player does not win.

Philosophical aside.

Life is like poker with only 1 round. You get dealt a hand; your genes, your parents, your socio-economic status, an crazy investor, ... cancer.
<!-- a picture of this would be nice! -->
If it's a bad hand. You don't get to fold and try again.

There are two attitudes we can take to this situation.

- that's the hand you are dealt. If it's bad, tough luck.
- attempt to fix the game. Make it fairer.

<!-- want to reduce the variance? want to make the game invariant to initial conditions. then there is no luck?! -->
Insurance is an example of the second attitude.

1-round Poker with insurance.
How would this work?
I am insured against bad hands. If I am dealt a bad hand, I get compensated.

In the past... 

- (before 1921 when insulin was discovered and later synthesised) diabetes was a loosing hand. Your life was just a few months (max) after diagnosis.
- (before 1943 when penicillin was discovered) bacterial infections were a loosing hand. Your life was just a few weeks (max) after diagnosis.
- 

No matter how good a player you were. You could not win with these hands.

Today, these hands are not so bad. You can win with them.

Given the stakes, it would be more fair if
