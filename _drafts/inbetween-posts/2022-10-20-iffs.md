title: Illicit financial flows
layout: post
---

Imagine a hidden river, flowing not with water, but with wealth stolen from the public good. This river and it's catchment; tax evasion, corruption, arms trade, ..., are what we call Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs). While unseen, its impact is devastating, eroding the foundations of our society and fueling some of the most pressing issues we face. Let's delve into the murky depths of IFFs and see how they do harm:

<!-- 
how much money is made by money launderers?
acountants, lawyers, bankers, politicians, etc.
what are the economics of this industry? 
-->


I think money laundering and illicit financial flows are __our greatest problem__. They are breaking our society.

I wrote this blog post because, I believe that IFFs are under-researched and under-appreciated. (ie not a popular topic, not on the political agenda, not listed as an important issue in the EA forums)

If we do a search on EA forums we get;

If we search recent media, ...

Aside. What capitalism was supposed to be;

> people are __rewarded for their contributions to society__, with a token, we call this money. they are __free__ to spend that token as they see fit.

How do IFFs do harm?
Bank balances, accounting ..., and stock prices are abstract ideas. 
How does the manipulation of these numbers cause harm in the real world?

Let's look at some high profile case studies to see how IFFs do harm:

- [kleptocrats](#kleptocrats)
- [illicit resource trade](#illicit-resource-trade)
- [arms trade and conflict financing](#arms-trade-and-conflict-financing)
- [lobbying and corruption](#lobbying-and-corruption)
- [tax evasion](#tax-evasion)
- [Monopolies and the Erosion of Trust](#monopolies-and-the-erosion-of-trust)

### Kleptocrats {#kleptocrats}

Kleptocrat: "a ruler who uses their power to steal their country's resources."

#### The 1MDB Scandal

> The 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal ... is an ongoing corruption, bribery and money laundering conspiracy in which the 1MDB fund was systematically embezzled. Although it began in 2009 in Malaysia, the scandal's global scope implicated institutions and individuals in politics, banking, and entertainment, and led to criminal investigations in a number of nations. The 1MDB scandal has been ... declared by the United States Department of Justice as the "largest kleptocracy case to date" in 2016.
A 2015 document leak reported in The Edge, Sarawak Report, and The Wall Street Journal showed that Malaysia's then-Prime Minister Najib Razak had channeled over RM 2.67 billion (about US$700 million) into his personal bank accounts from 1MDB, a government-run strategic development company.

#### Khazakstan



### Isabel dos Santos, Angola's "Richest Woman"

Despite her impoverished country's struggles, dos Santos amassed a multi-billion dollar fortune through alleged corruption and misappropriation of state assets. Investigations revealed complex webs of shell companies and offshore accounts used to channel illicit funds, showcasing the sophisticated methods employed by high-level actors. (References: DW, Bloomberg)

### Vladimir Putin and the russian Oligarchs

The Russian president and his inner circle have been accused of using IFFs to amass vast wealth and influence, with allegations of corruption, money laundering, and human rights abuses. Investigations into the Panama Papers and other leaks have exposed the extent of these illicit flows, revealing the systemic vulnerabilities that enable such activities. (References: OCCRP, The Guardian)

The result of this theft of public resources is that the people of these countries are left in poverty. They are unable to access basic services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while their leaders live in luxury and opulence. The impact of IFFs on developing countries is particularly severe, exacerbating inequality and hindering economic development.

### Illicit Resource Trade

Profiting fom the exploitation of natural resources, often in conflict zones, is a common tactic used by warlords and corporation to generate funds.

#### Blood diamonds

<!-- RUF, Charles Taylor, De Beers, etc. -->

Bl

#### Illegal fishing



#### Illegal logging: Khmer Rouge

The Khmer Rouge regime (perpetrators of the 4th largest genocide) used illegal logging to fund its brutal rule. Investigations into the illicit timber trade revealed the complicity of corrupt officials and criminal networks, highlighting the human and environmental cost of IFFs.

***

Similar to Kleptocrats, the illegal exploitation of natural resources (aka resources owned by the public) for personal gain is a form of theft. It deprives the people of these countries of the benefits of their own resources, while enriching a select few. The environmental impact of these activities is also severe; climate change, deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity.

And don't even get us started on oil and gas... There is not enough time to list all the ways in which the extraction and sale of these resources have fueled conflict, corruption, and environmental destruction around the world.

Also. Mining, agriculture, etc. 

### The Arms Trade and Conflict Financing

The flow of illicit funds often fuels conflicts around the world. Investigations into arms dealers like Viktor Bout, nicknamed the "Merchant of Death," revealed complex networks used to circumvent sanctions and supply weapons to war zones, highlighting the human cost of IFFs.

### The Iraq war, Dick Cheney and Haliburton

My understanding of the Iraq war is that a motivator of invasion was: Iraq had lots of oil. But this oil was exclusively for Iraq's nationalised oil industry. "A decade of war later, the oil fields are largely privatized and utterly dominated by foreign firms."

To be fair, there were other reasons for invasion as well. Saddam Hussein was overall a bad man. But there are many other bad people in power.

> Dick Cheney's old company Halliburton has profited from the mess in Iraq at the expense of American troops and taxpayers. While Halliburton has been engaging in massive overcharging and wasteful practices under this no-bid contract, Dick Cheney has continued to receive compensation from his former company. [ref](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/us/a-closer-look-at-cheney-and-halliburton.html)

(this isn't a good example? we know that Dick was recieving money. it didnt need to be laundered. it was just corruption that wasn't checked?! tho it is an example of money being used to buy things that shouldnt be purchaseable. )

## How does it work?

I am not particularly interested in the arms trade, or illegal logging, or Russian oligarcs... 
Rather I am interested in the system / network / machinery that allows them to profit from; theft, slavery,

### The Panama Papers

This massive leak exposed a global network of offshore accounts and shell companies used by wealthy individuals and businesses to hide assets and evade taxes. While not all cases involved illegal activity, the leak highlighted the systemic vulnerabilities that enable IFFs and the widespread impact on public finances. (References: ICIJ, The Guardian)


## Everything is for sale... even things that 'shouldn't' be for sale.

[What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13221379-what-money-can-t-buy)

If you have enough money you can buy;

- diplomatic immunity,
- citizenship,
- legal ??? to cripple your competitors,
- more money. yes. you can buy more money... (steal with impunity?! evade taxes. purchase public resources for cheap etc) (almost always at the cost of others)

Stops the ability to assign credit.
But why is this bad?
If the activity is illegal, then it may not be possible to trace the money back to the source.
