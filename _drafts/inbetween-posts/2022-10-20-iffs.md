title: Illicit financial flows
layout: post
---

I think money laundering and illicit financial flows are __the greatest problem__ in the world. They are breaking our society.

I believe this is problem is a necessary cause* of all the bad things; 
- illegal arms dealers, ... war, 
- special interest lobbying .. climate change, 
- humman traffiking in ???
- opiod crisis,
- inequality, tax evasion, ...

*Necessary as in [necessary vs sufficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency). The other necessary causes being; human nature - in particular greed, .

Behind all of these disasters and all this suffering is someone making a profit and living large. Cunt. Their life of luxury is made possible by laundering their profits and using that cleaned money to buy things that shouldn't be purchasable.

I wrote this blog post because, I believe that IFFs are under-researched and under-appreciated. (ie not a popular topic, not on the political agenda, not listed as an important issue in the EA forums)

If we do a search on EA forums we get;
- 

If we search recent media, ... 
- ?

My goal is to elicit a physical reaction. A feeling of anger. That motivates solving this problem asap.


Definitions.

- money laundering
- illicit finalcial flows

## How do IFFs do harm?

Bank balances and stock prices are abstract ideas. How does the manipulation of these numbers cause harm in the real world?

Fascilitates;

- inequality and poverty
- climate change and pollution 
- violence and war
- drugs and crime
- corruption and anti-trust
- 

<aside>

Aside. What capitalism was supposed to be;

> people are __rewarded for their contributions to society__, with a token, we call this money. they are __free__ to spend that token as they see fit.

</aside>

### Inequality and poverty

 (ie through tax evasion, corruption)


### Climate change

### The Iraq war, Dick Cheney and Haliburton

My understanding of the Iraq war is that a motivator of invasion was: Iraq had lots of oil. But this oil was exclusively for Iraq's nationalised oil industry. "A decade of war later, the oil fields are largely privatized and utterly dominated by foreign firms."

To be fair, there were other reasons for invasion as well. Saddam Hussein was overall a bad man. But there are many other bad people in power.

> Dick Cheney's old company Halliburton has profited from the mess in Iraq at the expense of American troops and taxpayers. While Halliburton has been engaging in massive overcharging and wasteful practices under this no-bid contract, Dick Cheney has continued to receive compensation from his former company. [ref](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/us/a-closer-look-at-cheney-and-halliburton.html)

(this isn't a good example? we know that Dick was recieving money. it didnt need to be laundered. it was just corruption that wasn't checked?! tho it is an example of money being used to buy things that shouldnt be purchaseable. )

want a NZ example?

## How does it work?

Players

- The big 4 accounting consultancies: EY, PWC, Deloitte, KPMG.

## Everything is for sale... even things that 'shouldn't' be for sale.

If you have enough money you can buy;

- diplomatic immunity,
- citizenship,
- legal ??? to cripple your competitors,
- more money. yes. you can buy more money... (steal with impunity?! evade taxes. purchase public resources for cheap etc) (almost always at the cost of others)

Stops the ability to assign credit.
But why is this bad?
If the activity is illegal, then it may not be possible to trace the money back to the source.
