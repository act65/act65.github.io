![Conductor]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/conductor.jpeg)

When I look at a conductor, I don't see a person in control of the orchestra. I see a delusion.

It seems to me that the music would happen with or without the conductor.
However, the conductor believes that they are in control of the music. They believe that the music would not happen without them.
Confusing correlation with causation, they raise their hands, and the crescendo begins.

I believe this is the perfect metaphor for consciousness. Like the conductor, we believe that we are in control of our thoughts and actions.
That we are making the music that is our life.
