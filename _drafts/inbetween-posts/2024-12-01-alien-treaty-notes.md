<!-- 
Aliens come and offer peace, trade and protection.
They offer us a treaty.

However, they have far superior technology / power.
We are unable to enforce the terms of the treaty.

While aliens are benevolent, they have their own ways of doing things. A different culture.
Human values (like ???) are given less priority. (maybe  art, ...? the aliens are more pragmatic, utilitarian, ...)

This is a parable / parallel of The treaty of Waitangi.

THE HIGH COUNCIL OF THE GALACTIC FEDERATION, regarding with their Distinguished Consideration the Nations and Peoples of Earth, and being desirous to protect their rightful Interests and Resources and to secure for them the benefits of Interstellar Peace and Advancement, has deemed it necessary, in light of the increasing interactions between Earth and other civilizations, and the rapid expansion of cosmic commerce and cultural exchange, to establish a formal diplomatic relationship with the inhabitants of Earth.

The Galactic Federation, wishing to establish a structured framework of Interstellar Governance to prevent the adverse consequences that would result from Earth's isolation in an increasingly connected galaxy, and to provide Earth's population access to advanced technologies and protections, has authorized Ambassador Zyx-427, Supreme Diplomatic Envoy of the Galactic Federation, to invite the United Nations and independent nations of Earth to agree to the following Articles and Conditions.

Article the First:

The Nations of Earth, both through their United Nations representation and as independent sovereign states, hereby cede to the Galactic Federation absolutely and without reservation all rights and powers of Interstellar Governance, which said Nations currently exercise or may be supposed to exercise, particularly in matters concerning extra-planetary affairs and space-based activities.

Article the Second:

The Galactic Federation confirms and guarantees to the Nations and Peoples of Earth the full and undisturbed possession of their Terrestrial Territories, Resources, and Cultural Heritage, which they may collectively or individually possess, so long as it is their wish to retain the same in their possession; but the Nations of Earth grant to the Galactic Federation exclusive rights of First Contact and Negotiation regarding any extra-planetary resources or territories they may wish to utilize, at such terms as may be agreed upon between Earth's representatives and the Federation's appointed mediators.

Article the Third:

In consideration thereof, the Galactic Federation extends to the inhabitants of Earth its protection and grants them all the Rights and Privileges of Federation Citizens, subject to Federation protocols and procedures.

(signed) Ambassador Zyx-427, Supreme Diplomatic Envoy

This treaty, being fully explained and translated to Earth's representatives, is hereby accepted and ratified by the undersigned nations and their authorized representatives, in full understanding of its provisions and implications.

Over arching theme.
Humans face discrimination (in a new form) from the aliens.
And their culture is being eroded.
This is subtle and slow.
But after a few generations, humanity is unrecognizable.
And they have little power to change things.

The aliens genuinely want to help but dont understanding the importance of intangible heritage
-->


<!--
Translation issues

Humans understand "Interstellar Governance" as only applying to space-related matters
Aliens interpret it as complete oversight of all human affairs, as they see no logical distinction between terrestrial and space governance 

Humans interpret "Cultural Heritage" as meaning all human customs, art, and practices will be preserved
Aliens view some human practices as "inefficient" or "illogical" and believe their mandate to advance humanity overrides cultural preservation 
-->

<!-- 
Discrimination issues

Jobs select for those who embrace alien ways (or are alien), leaving traditionalists marginalized.
Also favour people who understand alien tech.

Human Character: Dr. Sarah Chen

A young linguistic anthropologist (early 30s) when first contact occurs
Initially hired to help translate alien communications
Becomes one of the key human negotiators during the treaty process
Has a deep passion for preserving human cultural heritage
Over the decades, we see her growing from optimistic interpreter to concerned observer
By the end, she's an elderly woman watching her grandchildren embrace alien ways
Personal goals: (initially) to fasiliate lasting peace and understanding between humans and aliens.
Personal conflict: She helped facilitate the treaty but gradually realizes its unintended consequences

Alien Character: Ven-X (nicknamed "Ven" by humans)

A junior diplomatic attachÃ© assigned to study human culture (it's their first assignment)
Genuinely fond of humans but cannot fully comprehend their "illogical" attachments to tradition
Rises through diplomatic ranks over the decades
Believes they're 'helping' humanity progress but is blind to the discrimination and cultural destruction
Has a friendship/professional relationship with Sarah that becomes increasingly strained
Personal goals: To share the benefits of the Federation's knowledge and technology. To uplift others (like Ven was uplifted by the Federation).
Personal conflict: Torn between duty to the Federation and growing understanding of human perspectives

The main source of conflit between Sarah and Ven's beliefs is their different understanding of "advancing humanity".

Their stories interweave through the chapters:
Chapters 1-2: Sarah is part of the first team to decode alien messages. Ven is part of the advance team studying humans from orbit.
Chapter 3-4: They meet when Ven is assigned as a cultural liaison. They work together preparing for the treaty, developing a close friendship based on their mutual excitement about the future.
Chapter 5: Both play key roles in the treaty signing. Sarah helps explain it to human leaders, while Ven helps draft the alien version.
Chapter 6: Their relationship becomes strained as Sarah notices concerning changes. Ven doesn't understand her worries.
Chapter 7: Sarah's grandchildren prefer spending time with Ven, learning alien ways. This creates personal tension.
Chapter 8: Elderly Sarah confronts Ven about what's been lost. Ven finally begins to understand, but it's too late.
