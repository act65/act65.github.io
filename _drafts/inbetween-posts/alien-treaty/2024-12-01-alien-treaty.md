In NZ there has recently been a lot of talk about the treaty of Waitangi with the introduction of the [Treaty principles bill](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0094/latest/whole.html).
I read a book on the treaty of Waitangi and I wanted to share / explore what I learned.
My goal here is to write a sci-fi story that parallels (as much as possible) the treaty of Waitangi, the context it was drafted and its consequences.
I wrote this with copious help from claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022.
