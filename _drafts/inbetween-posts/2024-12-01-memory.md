<!-- 
basic idea; an alternative history / future where anasthetics were never invented.
instead, use memory erasure.
take rohypnol, forget everything.

workers in the future are given memory erasure drugs to forget the work they did.
- classified work
- access to private information (doctors? lawers? ...?)
- sex work

surgery and operations are pretty gruesome.

can explore;
- who are you if you don't remember your past?
- are you responsible for your actions if you don't remember them?
- the idea of memory as a form of identity
- the ethics of turning a blind eye

 "The Forgetting Trade"

I remember the moment right before I forgot. Always do. It's like a curtain falling, that chemical sweetness flooding the back of my throat as the pill dissolves. Then nothing, until I wake up hours later, body aching in new and mysterious ways.

Today's client paid premium for a full blank - twelve hours gone, just like that. My handler says I was cleaning financial records, scrubbing transactions for some corporation or another. The less I know, the better. That's the whole point of being a professional forgetter.

The bruises on my fingers suggest a lot of typing. My neck is stiff. But the work itself? Gone. Like it never happened.

Some people can't handle the gaps. They quit after a few months, too disturbed by the missing time. Me? I've been doing this for five years. You get used to it. The human mind is surprisingly adaptable to discontinuity.

My neighbor Teresa is a surgical assistant. She takes double doses - one to forget the procedure itself, another to forget the screams. Without anesthesia, modern medicine is medieval. But hey, at least the patients forget too.

"How do you know you're still you?" she asked me once, during one of our rooftop smoking sessions. "With all those holes in your memory?"

I didn't have a good answer then. Still don't. But I keep showing up for work, swallowing that little blue pill, waking up with fresh gaps in my timeline and money in my account.

The thing is, memory isn't just about remembering. It's about becoming. Every experience shapes us, remembered or not. I'm not the same person I was five years ago, even if I can't tell you exactly how I've changed.

Last week, I woke up with scratches down my arms and a note in my pocket: "Don't take any more jobs from Maxwell Corp." No memory of writing it, of course. But I trust my forgotten self enough to heed the warning.

That's the dirty secret of the forgetting trade - the things you do still happened. The body remembers, even when the mind forgets. We're all just walking archives of erased moments, carrying the weight of experiences we'll never recall.

My handler called this morning. New job tomorrow, high-paying client. Medical records, probably, or maybe government work. Could be sex work - they never tell us beforehand. Doesn't matter. I'll take the pill, do whatever needs doing, and wake up none the wiser.

Teresa says there's a black market for memory recovery drugs. Expensive and dangerous, but they work. Sometimes I'm tempted. But then I think about all those surgical assistants who tried it, who had to relive every scream, every cut, every moment they were meant to forget.

Some things are better left unknown.

<!-- Besides, did it really happen if you don't remember it? Philosophers have been arguing about that one since the pills first hit the market. I've got my own theory: everything happens, memory or not. We're all just choosing which parts of reality we get to keep. -->

Tomorrow, I'll wake up with another gap in my memory. Another paycheck. Another set of mysterious aches and pains. And life will go on, one forgotten moment at a time.

Because that's the real truth about memory erasure - it doesn't make things unhappen. It just makes us better at pretending they didn't.

I pop the pill into my mouth, feel that familiar sweetness. The curtain falls.

And then...
