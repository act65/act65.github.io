John is a rich, white, male. Which makes him a minority in 3 ways.

- Few people are as rich as John. Few others can really understand what John's life is like.
- White people are a minority, and colored people are the majority. Also John is easily sunburned.
- John is a male, and men are outnumbered by women.

Fortunately, John is being helped by a new university policy: "Support for minorities".

***

The point is. Being a minority is not the issue. It about power. Who has the (majority of) power?  
Well, that's: Rich, white, males.
