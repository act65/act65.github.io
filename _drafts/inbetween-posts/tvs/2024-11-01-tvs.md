I made a game. My first!

***

__Arthur Scherbius__ built the Engima encryption machine. It was used in World War 2 to encrypt German military communications. __Alan Turing__ is credited with 'breaking' the Enigma encrpytion and using the intel to win the war. 

> Alan Turing: We need your help, to keep this a secret from Admiralty, Army, RAF, uh...as no one can know, that we've broken Enigma, not even Dennison.<br>
...<br>
Alan Turing: While we develop a system to help you determine how much intelligence to act on. Which, uh, attacks to stop, which to let through. Statistical analysis, the minimum number of actions it will take, for us to win the war - but the maximum number we can take before the Germans get suspicious.
(quote from The Imitation Game)

To win this game as 'Turing', this game requires you to;
- A) break a code,
- B) exploit the broken code, without revealing you have broken it. 

The idea for this game is from a friend (Nick Johnstone aka Widdershin).
