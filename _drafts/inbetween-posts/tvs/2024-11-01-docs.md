# Overview

The game is split into three parts.

- the core logic of the game (implemented in rust)
- the frontend (implemented in flask)
- the RL agent (implemented in python / jax)

## Core logic

Why did I implement the core logic in rust?
Good question. 

I knew I wanted to do some reinforcement learning, so I wanted the core logic to be fast.
I also wanted to learn rust.


I have implemented the core game in rust with some small changes;

- encryption is based on a 'simple' version of enimga. Aka, a 2 rotor polynumeric substitution cipher.
- re-encryption now costs victory points
- you can send as many or as few resources to a single battle as you like (rather than max 2).

## Frontend



## RL agent

I have implemented a RL agent to play the game.
