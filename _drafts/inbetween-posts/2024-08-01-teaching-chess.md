Chess game.
Each player teaches a ML model to play chess.
The have access to 


<!-- TODO 

make an image of a talent tree; RL algorithms, extra (famous) games, bigger compute budget,
(dont want it to be pay to win. how would these be earned? experience?)

 -->


 design decisions:

- use RL or supervised learning? (the model learn from only the games provided? or can simulate new games?)



 <!--  
I am building a talent tree for a chess game. The game involves players managing the learning of a ML model (by; providing games - which they generate, designing puzzles, picking curricula, giving feedback on better / worse moves, picking learning algorithms).

The talent tree has two branches:
- Extra (famous) games (e.g. Carlsen vs. Stockfish (2018), Fischer vs. Spassky (1972), ...)
- Feedback types (win / lose, ranking better / worse moves, counterfactuals)



The talent tree has three branches:
- Extra (famous) games
  - Carlsen vs. Stockfish (2018)
  - AlphaZero vs. Stockfish (2017)
  - Kasparov vs. Deep Blue (1997)
  - Fischer vs. Spassky (1972)
  - ...
- Puzzles
  - Endgame
  - Opening
  - Middle game
- Feedback types
  - win / lose
  - Ranking better / worse moves
  - Counterfactuals
- RL algorithm
  - DQN
  - A3C
  - PPO

Please generate an image for the icon of the extra famous games upper level talent. The icon should show a crowd of chess players over a chess board in an animate steampunk-esque style.
