<!-- people think ai future is dangerous -->
There is lots of talk of the dangers of AI.

- it's going to turn everything into paperclips
- it's going to kill us because we littered

<!-- twitter pics etc -->

<!-- 
really this is about how we solve problems / achieve goals.

 -->

<!-- RL related -->
Some of these worries are valid, to an extent.
The way reinforcement learning works is by giving an AI a goal and letting it figure out how to achieve that goal.

For example, we want a robot to clean our house. We give it a goal to clean the office. We let it figure out how to clean the office.
It's a complicated problem to design an algorithm to clean a house. Where do you start? What do you do first? What do you do next? How do you know when you're done?

So we let the robot figure it out. We give it a reward for cleaning up messes. We give it a penalty for making messes. We let it learn from its mistakes (ideally in suimulation to avoid real world consequences).

However, we care how the robot cleans up the mess. We don't want it to break things, or hurt people. We want it to clean up the mess in a way that is safe and efficient. But, the rewards we give the robot are not always aligned with our goals.
This is the problem of 'AI alignment'. Also known as reward hacking, or the paperclip maximizer problem.

<!-- more (fun) examples -->

<!-- mechanism design -->
Within economics, mechanism design is the study of how to design rules and incentives to get people to do what you want them to do.
We start from the end goal, and work backwards to design the rules and incentives that will get us there.

For example, we want people to drive safely. We design rules and incentives to get people to drive safely. We have speed limits, traffic lights, and fines for breaking the rules.

We want a way to encourage individuals to collaborate and contribute to the public good. To do useful things for others.
Corporations are our answer.
For example, (limited liability) Corporations protect individuals from the risks of starting a business. 
And they provide a legal framework to share ownership and responsibility.

So if we extend our metaphor. The cleaning robot correpsonds to corporations. And the rewards / goals are the laws and incentives that we design.

<!-- but -->
I think we can all agree that something has gone wrong in our design of the corporate mechanism.
The rules and incentives are not quite right. Corporations often put the needs of their shareholders above the needs of society. They game the system to maximize their profits, often at the expense of the public good.

If you need some examples, just look at the 2008 financial crisis, the opioid epidemic, the tobacco industry, etc etc I'm not even going to touch on the military industrial complex or climate change.

<!-- so -->
What are our options?

Limited Liability Company
S corporation
C corporation
Nonprofit
Divisional structure
Functional structure
Kommanditgesellschaft
Matrix structure
General partnership
Partnership
Limited liability partnership

<!-- securities laws, antitrust laws, and environmental regulations -->

<!-- what is a corporation, exactally -->
According to 


<!-- however.  -->

Corporations gamed loopholes in regulations which lead to the 2008 financial crisis. Trillions of dollars and thousands of lives lost.Â JP Morgan Chase" and others...

Corporations manipulate regulations to maximize their profits. Billions of dollars made from the suffering of others. Phillip Morris profits from giving people lung cancer. Exxon Mobil profits from exacerbating climate change. Arms companies, ...

While these corporations game and manipulate the rules they are supposed to follow, we worry about nonexistent cleaning robots that kill the messy (they also gamed their regulations).

Killing machines are already here.\
They are called corporations.\
They are already killing us. \
They are already killing the planet.\
They are already killing the future.
