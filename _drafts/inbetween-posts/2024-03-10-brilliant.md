Aliens on a distant planet have a unique way of communicating. They use visual patterns generated on their bodies to convey messages. 
The patterns can convey entire sentences in a single image. (like in the heptapods in arrival) 

This planet has has frequent auroras that light up the sky.
The aliens are deeply religious and believe that the auroras are messages from their gods.

Most of the time, the auroras are random patterns. But every once in a while, the patterns form a word / sentence.
These are the words of the gods.
