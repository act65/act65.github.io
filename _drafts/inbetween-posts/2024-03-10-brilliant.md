<!-- 
Aliens on a distant planet have a unique way of communicating. They use visual patterns generated on their bodies to convey messages. 
The patterns can convey entire sentences in a single image. (like in the heptapods in arrival) 

This planet has has frequent auroras that light up the sky.
The aliens are deeply religious and believe that the auroras are messages from their gods.

Most of the time, the auroras are random patterns. But every once in a while, the patterns form a word / sentence.
These are the words of the gods.
--> 

The gods have not spoken in 2 months and 3 days.
Abas lies awake, staring at the ceiling of his hut. The walls are covered in the patterns, famous quotes, prayers and words of the gods. The patterns are beautiful, intricate and mesmerizing. They are the only thing that keeps him sane.



<!-- why is sound often used for communcation between animals? when visual stimuli could also do it? -->
