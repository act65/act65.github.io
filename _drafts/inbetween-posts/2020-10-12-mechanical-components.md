You may already be familiar with electrical components like; transistors, capacitors, operational-amplifiers, flip-flops, etc...  Electrical components are defined as; ...?

Have we discovered all the possible kinds of mechanical part?

With analogues of the various electrical components. 

Transformers, aka gears

..?

## Characterising mechanical types

Much like 

Lets make a quick list;

Angular

Gears: \omega \to k\omega

Gyroscope: (related to inductor?)

mechanical angular speed controller

Fly wheel: (related to capacitor?!)

Differential gear: 

(name of mechanical device that increases inertia as speed increases!?)

Linear

Whippletree

Angular and linear

Wheel: v \to \omega

Crank: \omega \to v

Pulley:

Ratchet

(what about springs...?)

Modern applications

This question of: whether we have found all kinds of mechanical part, has renewed relevance with the development of molecular machines. Ref.
