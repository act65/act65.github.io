title: Determisism
subtitle: What are the implications of believing in physics on free-will?

Either;

- random
- deterministic

Implications I have identified;

- addictive products should be carefully regulated. We are not really in control,
- punishment is not a good idea. Tho imprisonment still makes sense, but is justified via arguments from safety (this person is a violent danger to others, and therefore should be physically isolated / not able to harm others). Similar argument for abusive / manipulative people? (this person is a psychological danger to others, and therefore should be socially isolated / not able to harm others)
- veil of ignorance / equality /  ... survivorship bias

***

Despite this. It feels like we are in control. And this seems to matter. Taking 'responsibility' for your actions is a good thing.
