Hello potential customer, welcome. Here is the pitch:

Purchase health insurance from us for $5,000 per year. 
You can reduce that cost by giving us information and following our advice.

Our business model is simple.

We make money by reducing the costs of your health care. 
We set your insurance cost to be the average cost of health care.
We bet that the advice we give, the regular check ups we schedule, the nudges we provide, will make you healthier.
Thus, we make money and you live longer!


We do this by providing preventive care and by nudging you to take care of yourself.

- If we can catch the cancer early (through regular screening), we make money. 
- If we prevent a heart attack (through your diet and exercise reigime), we make money. 
- If we catch a calcium defficiency early (through regular blood tests) and thus avoid a potential broken bone, we make money.

Gambits / nudges:

<!-- behaviourial econ? -->

- If you agree to have your genome sequenced, we will reduce the cost by $500 per year (we pay for the sequencing).
- If you wear a fitness tracker and hit predetermined goals we will reduce the cost by $250 per year.
- If you show up to your 3 month check up we will reduce the cost by $50.

## Preventative healthcare

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/my-insurance-company-ipo/care.png)

It is well known that our current system is lazy. We wait utill you are sick, or have noticable symptoms, before we act.
Often this is too late, the health outcomes are poor and the costs are high.

For example, aetherosclerosis (the build up of plaque in your arteries) is a slow process that can start in your 20s. It can lead to a heart attack in your 50s. Depending on how early we catch it, the cost of treatment can vary from $0 (if we change your diet and exercise) to $30,000 for an angioplasty to $100,000 (if we catch it late).

Preventative healthcare is the idea that we can reduce the costs of health care by preventing diseases before they occur. This is done by regular check ups, screenings, and by nudging you to take care of yourself. While most agree that this is a good idea, the current system does not incentivise this behaviour.

## Aligning incentives

The incentives of current insurers and insured are not well aligned.
Your insurer makes money as long as you are alive to pay your premiums.
Though, if you bound to a hospital bed, they simply increase your premiums.

<!-- Make money vs live a long healthy life. -->

<!-- how does helth insueance work. does it increase in cost over time? -->


Now, I claim, we, the insurance providers, have a large incentive to accurately forecast your future health, and to gather information that is predictive of future complications and to act to minimise your health care costs.

Imagine (or maybe you don't have to...). Your genome reveals that you have the HER2 gene. We schedule and pay for regular screenings starting from when you turn 40. The logic being that the earlier we catch the cancer, the less damage it does and thus we have a smaller bill to insure! A win-win!

## Problems

There are some problems I can see with this idea:

__Privacy__. To make accurate predictions, we need to know a lot about you. This may concern some. There may be ways to mitigate this concern through clever use of encryption and other technologies.

__Gaming our system__. It's easy to imagine people trying to game our system. For example, they could wear a fitness tracker on their dog and claim the steps as their own. Care will have to be taken in designing our nudges and rewards to avoid this.

__Fairness__. We need to make sure that our system is fair. 
We don't want to charge people more for insurance due to factors out of their control (e.g. their genome).
