Do you suffer from a heavy conscience? Are there burdens of the modern world that weigh you down? Do you feel as though the suffering of others anchors you to the ground, shackling your freedom? Do you feel guilty when you could help someone, but choose not to?

Do we have the solution for you!!!

Aaron, a 26 year old homeless person in New York. Who spent the majority of available money on cigarettes. He was severely malnourished and generally close to starving. He froze to death in his home, under the Manhattan bridge.

Karma. (_he was a selfish English Lord in his previous life_)

Anu, a 14 year old girl in India, who was caught robbing a house by the owners who then sold her into bonded labor and has now been a sex slave for the past 3 years.

Karma. (_she stole_)

Amir, an extremist who recently graduated Tehran university. He who was caught attempting to blow up a local bus. He is sentenced to death and hung.

Karma. (_he was an extremist in this life_)

They deserve what they get because they are being punished for their wrong doings in this life and/or their past lives.

But wait a minute;

Amir is in that position because of the levels of destitution and violence around him. He wanted to make a difference and change the status quo, so he turned to the only group still around that was trying to change things... (extremist cell) - (_this is a theory of mine and possibly others - that the poor conditions and lack of hope has pushed many people toward extremist views_). And why was he in such a poor and violent state? Because his country had more oil then it knew what to do with, which many militia groups sought to control, thus there was constant civil war, with no stable government  - thus letting infrastructure decay. This suited America and it's petrochemical companies as they preferred favourable trade agreements over worrying about local conditions.

Anu is one of millions of orphans in India. There is no one coming to help her, she is a dalit. As she has not been graced with beauty it is unlikely anyone will notice her plight. She has to steal from local markets and scavenge rubbish to stave off starvation. She has lived like this for 3 years since her parents abandoned her. Her parents, like many others, realise that they cannot afford to take care of their daughter (in favour of their sons) so they abandon (or sell) them. She decided to steal money, possessions and whatever else she could find so that she could support herself and possibly even go to school.

Aaron is just a product of a poor house hold environment and lack of education. When Arron was in his mothers womb she drank heavily, smoked and did some hard drugs, while also suffering from acute malnutrition. (_If there are not enough resources/nutrients during growth in the placenta the fetus will cut corners starting with mental faculties._) This meant that Aaron had an IQ of 94. His father was lazy and always bought takeaways, (McDonalds and KFC were his favorites) ensuring that Aaron was overweight for much of his childhood, this led to bullying during school and psychological disorders to haunt him. Now who would want to hire a stupid mentally unstable person? Arron didn't have any family or friends who cared or wanted to help.

How can we blame these people for who they are, when the problem is clearly their environment. I imagine that I would have turned out almost exactly the same if I had similar experiences to these examples, but instead I was raised in a middle class household in a developed country with loving and responsible parents. No expense was spared for my eduction ... etc

I think that both Karma (which tells us that these people deserve what they get because of their past actions) and a common view, which is a mix of merit based views and the ignorance of luck, which tells us that;

- people are successful because they are smart and work hard
- people who are not capable are not deserving, and that the incapable should just work harder.

Both have some sort of moral elitism, where unfortunate people seem to deserve the little they get and the fortunate tell themselves they are better.

I dislike both.
