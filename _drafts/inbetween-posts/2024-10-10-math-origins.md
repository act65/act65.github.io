<!-- A short story that follows a trader. The story starts before the development of any math / arithmetic and we would get to see the issues that come with no math (spending lots of time counting, getting counts wrong, ...?). The accountant would invent some of their own tricks, and learn some from other accountants (in different cities). -->

the point of this story is to explore / understand / imagine the origins of math. 
to show that;
- even the simplest pieces of math were not always obvious.
- math has been collecting 'tricks' for thousands of years. building upon itself.


Ikram's character (possibilities):

He's a rather sly businessman. He understand that his image is important for trading. He needs people to trust him (learned through experience).
In the end he uses these mathematical tricks to help make himself seem more intelligent (and to make him money).

Simplicity and order. How can I show these are things that Ikram values? 
(and how can I show that these are things that are important for math?)

Possible scenes:
(which convey a mathematical discovery)

1. Ikran has a child assistant, who's job is mostly 'counting'. Where counting means drawing the icon for wheat on a tablet for each wheat bale in storage. He also has another child assistant for 'counting' the number of sheep in the pen, and another for counting the number of coins in the chest, and another for counting the number of jars of oil in the storage room, and another for counting the sacks of barley in storage, and another ...
Ikran trades in large volumes, e.g. 100s of hay bales. So he often he has to wait for things to be counted.
One day he's sitting at his desk, with 3 different count tablets. And he has the insight, that he could simplify this system. Instead of writing the icon for wheat, or sheep, or ..., he could just draw a single icon at the top of the tablet, and then draw a line for each item counted. He teaches his assistants how to use it and it saves time.

2. Ikram needs to purchase a field for grain storage. The seller describes it as "8 lengths by 15 lengths." (but how much wheat can it hold?)
Rather than the usual approach to determine the area (using small clay tokens to lay out a rectangle representing the field, and counting them one by one to determine the area) Ikram has an insight. He realizes he has seen these numbers before and he knows the answer. Last week he had 8 seperate orders of 15 bottles of wine, this totalled 120 bottles.
Later that week, while travelling (with idle time to think) he realisees he could list all the possible areas of a field with a length of 1 to 10, and a width of 1 to 10. This would give him a table of 100 areas. He could then use this table to quickly determine the area of any field by looking up the length and width in the table.
Now that Ikram knows how to determine the area of some land, he advertises this ability. A customer will come to him with measurements of their land, and Ikram will tell them how much wheat it can hold, for a small fee.
Uses. How many seeds do I need to purchase to plant this field which is N x M?


3. mismatch between old and new measurements (rod vs reed). and / or mismatch between units used by foreign traders and local. motivate the need for fractions.

Over arching storyline (possibilities);

is Ikram starts in a small town doing trade with neighboring towns. Moves to bigger city and learns some new tricks.
The bigger city is chaotic and ???. But math helps organise his life.

Other, (minor) possibilities.

- meets a friend and starts doing recreational math.
- discovers

set the scene / world building. 

This is based in Susa and Nippur.
Susa is a cluster of small towns, each with a few hundred people. It's main industry is farming (wheat, barley, dates, olives, sheep, goats, cattle). It's main export is wheat and barley.
the lands / cities to the north are mountainous (closer to afghanistan) traded in minerals and metals (copper, silver, gold, iron, lead, tin, ) and textiles (wool, silk, cotton).
the lands to the south are fertile and traded in plants (dates, olives, ) and animals (sheep, goats, cattle).
already exists a complex trade network.
Akkadian, aramic, and Sumarian are the main languages spoken.

mina and Shekel.
kurru and nindan.

Currently peace after ???

A few of the discoveries I'd like to include;

(these are all related to arithmetic)
- when traders develop a short-hand / symbols to represent their wheat bales (instead of writing ticks). And then realise they can use these same symbols to count beers, or other goods.
- The realisation that the units of area can be written in terms of units of length. 
- The standardisation of the sexagesimal system.
- the discovery of multiplication, and its uses (If I know I need -say- 3 bags of barley to make 10L of beer. Then how many bags to I need to make 85 L of beer? AND. Instead of counting all the ceramic vases stacked in this room, I can simply count the number of vases in the horizontal, depth and height directions and multiply - since the vases are stacked regularly).
- the cut-and-paste method for finding the reciprocal of a sexagesimal number. (pg 109)
- The discovery of place value notation
- The realization that debts can be recorded as negative quantities
- The invention of fractions for trading partial quantities

what about discoveries related to;
- geometry? (e.g. the 3-4-5 rule for right angles, or the discovery of the Pythagorean theorem)
- algebra? (e.g. the discovery of the quadratic formula, or the use of algebra to solve problems)

The Debt Record

> After being burned by a few bad deals, Ikran develops a system of recording who owes him what. He creates a special mark to indicate "owed goods" versus "goods in hand," essentially creating negative numbers. This evolves into a rudimentary lending system, where he begins charging extra (interest) for the convenience of paying later.


> (from LLM) Ikram attends a gathering of merchants from different cities, where they're all frustrated by their different counting systems. Through discussion and negotiation, they begin to see the benefits of adopting a common system - the sexagesimal system. This could be shown through a series of meetings and the gradual adoption of the new standard.

This could happen in the background of Ikram's life. He doesn't directly attend, but he hears about it from other traders and sees the impact it has on trade. It could be a way to show the interconnectedness of different cities and the importance of shared systems for trade.


***

Ikram is frustrated because his large trading operation requires keeping track of many different sized quantities. He uses different symbols for 1s, 10s, 60s, and 600s, but it's becoming unwieldy. One day, while watching his assistants arrange storage jars (which are stacked in neat rows and columns), he notices how the position of each jar tells him something about its contents. This gives him an idea: what if the position of a number symbol could tell you its value? He experiments with a system where a symbol's position indicates whether it represents ones, sixties, or three-thousand-six-hundreds.

Ikram is negotiating with another merchant who owes him grain but wants to continue trading. Currently, they use separate tablets for "owes me" and "I owe them" records, which is confusing when dealing with multiple traders. After a particularly complex trading session involving multiple debts in both directions, Ikram develops a new notation: marking debt quantities with a special symbol to distinguish them from positive quantities. This allows him to combine all transactions with a single trader onto one tablet.

Ikram needs to build new storage rooms along the city wall. The wall runs at an angle to his existing storehouse. He needs to know how much roofing material to purchase to span between the two structures. A young architect shows him how to measure the shortest distance between the buildings using a rope and the "3-4-5" rule, explaining that this always works for right angles. Ikram is fascinated and begins collecting other number combinations that work this way.

Ikram is teaching his daughter to use the balance scales. She's frustrated that adding small weights one by one takes so long. Together, they discover that if they know a large weight equals twenty small weights, they can use the large weight to speed up their measuring.
This leads to the development of a short-hand system for recording weights, where a single symbol represents twenty of the smaller weight.

Outtro.

Unlike in the story, it was not a single person who invented most of arithmetic, nor was it done in a single generation.
It took hundreds of years for these seemingly obvious insights to accumulate into a system that resembles modern arithmetic.
