Expletives!
What is with the weird notation that physicists use?!

$$
\phi: X\times Y \to \mathbb R \\
d\phi = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy
$$

- Wait, what are we differentiating with respect to?
- How come we have $\phi$ on the LSH, but $f$ on the RHS?!
- What is $d()$???

$d\phi: X \times Y \to \mathbb R$
Equals the jacobian. (when working in a vector space!?)

Best linear approximation at $x$.
