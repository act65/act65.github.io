My name is Alex. I want to be smart(er). This place for me to put the things I would like others to see. My notes and ideas about computer science and its applications;

___Brains, learning, languages, control, scientific method, natural sciences, computation, math, compression, automation, energy, ...___

For the things I don’t want people to see, check out my other [blog](https://act65com.wordpress.com/). Which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal.

I simply forked this blog from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and renamed it (it took me a couple of hours…). Feel free to fork the original or [mine](https://github.com/act65/act65.github.io).

Also. Here is my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}\CV.pdf).

Hey, some people call me Alex, my friends don't call me.

This blog is mainly here to help me organise my thoughts. I am a big advocate for writing/blogging. I think everyone should do it. If you need further convincing not to read my blog, read my post on [why write](https://act65com.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/why-write/).

I also [blog](http://act65.github.io/) about machine learning and related math.

Disclaimer: I have a habit of; being wrong, having self-serving beliefs, thinking that I know better and generally being irrational. Point being, sometimes I disagree with the idiot who wrote this blog, or worse, I still agree with him... Don't take it too seriously, I dont.
