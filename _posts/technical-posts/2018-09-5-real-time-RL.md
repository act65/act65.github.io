subtitle: Rewarding a twitter bot is more complicated than I imagined.
---

Imagine you want to make a twitter bot that is rewarded by likes, it adapts it's tweets in attempt to maximise its rewards.

Unlike the typical episodic setting, where the return can be calculated after some fixed amount of time, or when the episode halts (for example at the completion of a game of Go). In this setting, there is no (efficient and unbiased) way to estimate the return. Despite this, is there a way to act 'rationally'?

## A resource bounded oracle

In this setting we can think of the oracle as one that has bounded resources.
For example, it may have some finite computational power (and no memory). It searches through the past for useful actions. When it finds good actions it rewards them.


<!-- > is testing/evaluating your action and gives you feedback based on its current (possibly imperfect) knowledge. -->

<!-- - a bias towards recent actions (twitter and academia both seem to share this) -->
<!-- - is given monotonic rewards (in the case of likes and citiations, we could probably assume that, although it isnt quite true). -->

## Formal setting

At each time step, $t \in \mathbb Z^+$, you take an action $a^t \in A$ an recieve a reward $r^t \in \mathbb R^t$ (the size of the reward vector changes with $t$). The goal is to learn a poilcy $\pi$ that receives past actions and rewards that maximises $R^{\infty}$.

$$
a^{t+1} = \pi(a^{t:0}, r^{t:0}) \\
R^{\infty} = \mathop{\mathbb E}_{s_t \sim p(\cdot \mid a^{t:0})} \parallel r^i(s_t) \parallel \\
$$

<side>Does thinking about rewards like this help in the markov sequence setting? Where we only get to observe the sum across columns, $\sum_{i=0}^t \textbf{R}^t_i$. $\textbf{Q:}$ How much faster can learning occur when we have access to this information?</side>
We can write the rewards received as a matrix by stacking them horizontally.

$$
\begin{align}
\textbf{R}^t &= \begin{bmatrix}
r_0^0 & r_0^1 & r_0^2 & r_0^3 \\
 & r_1^1 & r_1^2 & r_1^3 \\
 &  & r_2^2 & r_2^3 \\
 &  &  & r_3^3 \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
&= [\text{actions taken} \times \text{time steps}]
\end{align}
$$


Where $r^t_n$ denotes the reward for the $n$th action recived at time $t$.

Note the size of $\textbf{R}^t$. We can imagine a point where we have taken thousands of actions and are receiving feedback on all of them. We may want to integrate this recent feedback with past feedback, which would require $\mathcal O(n^2)$ operations.

So given a time step, how might the rewards be distributed over the past actions?

<side>Is there anything dangerous/pathological about doing this?</side>
The velocity ($\Delta R$) and acceleration ($\Delta^2 R$) appear to be useful signals. A simple heurstic could be to maximise them in place of the true $R$.

## Problem

We dont get the return. So we cannot use X types of learning.
Also. TD updates dont make sense. WHY?!?!

If arbitrary things can happen in the future, the we have little hope of being able to learn much.
What if we know the rewards are monotonic? Still doesnt help much...

Without strong priors, this is a really hard problem!??!

## Learning

Learning in this setting poses some interesting quirks:

- we __really__ want to pick actions that will be useful in the long term! Ones that continue to pay off (or positively effect the reward of new actions)!
- because the relationship between actions and short term rewards are easier to learn (there is more data) we would expect an agent's behaviour to be myopic (how can this be avoided?)

as well as;

#### Counting on future rewards

<side>How/why is this any different for the usual setting? In the usual setting, the distinction is shitty action this time (give observations, action og another agent, ...)</side>

We need to distinguish between two cases; (1) shitty action, (2) payoff is still in the future.

For example consider the tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What do the fourier transform, uncertainty principle and statistical manifolds have in common?<br><br>If I have N samples on a statistical manifold then the more I know about local structure the less I know about global structure.</p>&mdash; Alexander Telfar (@telfarac) <a href="https://twitter.com/telfarac/status/999408963098558464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Does it have no likes because it is uninteresting/not clear/... not a good action? Or because the payoff still lies somewhere in the future. What am I to make of this? It leads to two interesting questions about the explore/exploit trade-off.

- $\textbf{Q:}$ How should we exploit our knowledge of past rewards to update our policy (even if we believe an action has a large payoff coming, but has not yet recieved any reward?).
- $\textbf{Q:}$ How should we explore alternatives given that we may never get a clear answer whether the action was good.

#### Dependence on the future

The reward received, $r_t$, at time, $t$, for the $i$th action (at time $t=i$) is dependent on past and future actions $r^t_i = R(a_t, \dots, a_0)$. This leaves open the possibility that you can take actions now that influence the rewards recieved by past actions. For example, "please retweet X". Heh, or citing your own past work...

<side>Can we make this notion of danger more formal?</side>
This seems very dangerous!! I imagine an agent in this setting would be very likely to start optimising something different to what we wanted as it now has the ability to give itself reward. $\textbf{Q:}$ How can we build a learner is protected against self-gratification? One that doesnt (/minimally) cite itself?
