Maslow's hierarchy of needs

- Physiological (air, water, food, sex, excretion, exercise, sleep, shelter...)
- Safety (security of body, of employment, of resources...)
- Love and belonging (friends, family, sexual intimacy)
- Esteem (prestige and feeling of accomplishment/achievement)
- Self-actualization (achieving ones full potential, self-worth)

My hierarchy of needs

Obviously the **physiological** ones are the same. Although I would possibly add in a few extras; clothes, access to electricity and an internet connection.

**Consistency** and **security**. Knowing where you are going to sleep for the next week. Knowing that you have enough money to last XXX days. Knowing that some random event won't endanger you because you have some sense control (are there different types of control?) over your life. This knowledge allows you to transcend the worries of everyday and focus on other things, ideas, the future, interesting problems, whatever makes you happy. (_But how do you balance this with change? As safe is boring? How do I ensure I don't fall into the same thought patterns and keep changing with the times? Or are these two things not mutual exclusive?_)

I am going to change 'Love and belonging' to a broader set of **psychological** needs in which I include; socialising, autonomy, lastly a sense of meaning and purpose. (I think t_he general trend of these is that they provide alternate sources of happiness from physiological comforts, thus allowing you to transcend the cravings of your body_) As much as our culture decries finding confidence and happiness from socialising (_people are encouraged to have internal sources of happiness and confidence, not external_) I think that I, and others, are hardwired to find value and happiness from others - this comes from the respect and validation that others provide. Having control over my life, having freedom and autonomy, gives me a sense of engagement in my own life. I have to actively direct it and be a part of it. (_many studies have shown the effects of taking/giving more or less control to people and its effects - the most famous study ended with a bunch of dead seniors_) I also need to see the things I do, my actions, as meaningful, otherwise what is the point? I need to be able to delude myself into thinking that I am special or better in some small way. Or that my actions are for some greater purpose.

Lastly, the highest level, I have reserved for **high level** processes such as; self-efficacy, meta-cognitive strategies (thinking about thinking, and learning about learning), self awareness and regulation, self-control, self-confidence (_internal_) and self-motivation. I think that the trend of all of these processes is that they take the power away from everyday life and events (_the culture you live in, how you were raised, peer pressures etc..._) that can shape you and give you the ability, and even the responsibility, to clear your own path (_transcending societal expectations and norms and doing what you think is best_). That is to choose for yourself, free of biases, heuristics and other influences, how you derive meaning from life and where you find motivation, confidence and happiness: thus being truly free.

Note: That my pyramid seems to relate to how far in the future your thoughts dwell. Also note the similarities to the aims of meditation and detaching from everyday events. Lastly, do these levels relate to levels of consciousness?
