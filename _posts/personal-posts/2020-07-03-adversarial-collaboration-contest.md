Scott Alexander holds a yearly [Adversarial collaboration contest](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/24/adversarial-collaboration-contest-2019/). I think it is a brilliant idea, it encourages contestants to be openminded and to engage in a tolerant debate. Rather than:

> "this is the hill I die on: fight me".

I would love to give it a go: here are some potential topics I would like to 'adversarially' collaborate on (my position);

1. Testing on Bonobos and Chimpanees is (currently) a necessary evil
2. Prisons should only be for those who are a likely physical danger to society
3. More QuALYs are taken (per year) by economic and digital warfare now, than actual warfare 50 years ago.
4. Anyone (that doesnt have a mental handicapp) can learn calculus
5. Most voters cannot list more than 3 of their parties' policies (with non-trivial detail)
