## What makes a good year?

Friends made? Money saved? Money spent? Time laughing? Time crying? Puzzles solved? Lessons learned? Knowledge gained? Girls conquered? Promotions received? Words written? Books read? Likes on Facebook? Followers on twitter? Days sober? Arguments won? Time not depressed? Time distracted? People helped? Lives saved?

Hmm. I just do not know. For me I think it is probably _time not depressed_. Which seems rather sad.

## What happened?

After a Mech Eng degree, and two years dragging my feet, I went back to uni and studied the thing I should have done in the first place. Computer science.

I went into the degree with the aim that; I would learn to enjoy myself. I would enjoy study, learning, programming ... and not get stressed out by; what others expect, being successful, being productive or appearing smart.

I went through a few different phases of motivation. At times I was super focused and got lost in a project (e.g. making a conv net from scratch). But most of the time I was distractible; youtube, facebook, random papers, the latest brain fart, ...

I justify this lack of focus as curiosity. And I sometimes wonder how people can commit soo much time to projects without doing a more thorough search of the alternatives. But, I can also see the other side of the argument. You learn best by doing (focus), and failing.

I have remained quite isolated. And have sometimes dreamt of total isolation, mainly from the pressures of the world and my expectations. A dangerous line of thought in my occasional opinion.

## How could it have been better?

- More focus. Start a project, accept that it wont be perfect. Make sure you don't let the scope get out of hand. Finish the project.
- Stop caring about appearing smart to others. Just do what you are interested in (which fortunately tends to be something related to computers, math, science, thinking and learning). This is easier said than done. I need a strategy/plan?
- Make more mistakes. Be bolder.
- Be more self aware. _Start journalling again_.
- Relax. Stop trying so hard.
