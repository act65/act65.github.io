I came across [nationaldebtclocks](https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/newzealand) and found myself hypnotized by our increasing debt, it just keeps going up, fast.

I did a couple of quick calculations and I figure that every NZer pays ~$1000 NZD per year in interest on our national debt (_138 $/sec x 60 sec/min x 60 min/hr x 24 hr/day x 365 day/yr divided by 4.7mill person = 925 $/person_).

(Note_: the_ [_treasuries_](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/liabilities) _estimate of our liabilities is $197.1 billion, which is a lot more than the nationaldebtclock’s value for our debt. ~$16,000 per person per year -- at 4% interest._)

Also, we are paying 4.8% interest per year, which is far higher than my bank will give me... (_4,360,121,813 $/yr / $90,814,035,922 = 0.048 -- from nationaldebtclocks_)

I have **questions**!!!

- Why are we in debt? Why is it necessary for governments to borrow capital from investors?
- What is a [government security](https://www.nzdmo.govt.nz/), and why would I want to buy one? Who does buy them? Why do they get such good interest rates? And why would the govt want to sell them?
- Where does the interest on our national debt go? Who do we owe it to? And how do these financiers/investors contribute to NZ?
- Why do we own [$30 billion in shares](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/financialstatements/yearend/jun17/21.htm)? What are those shares invested in? (it better not be oil, sugary food, alcohol, dairy, facebook, ...)

Time to investigate.
