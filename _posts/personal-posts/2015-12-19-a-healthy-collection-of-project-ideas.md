Keep a collection of ideas for projects. Don't worry about the reality of many of them.

I find this helpful for the times that I either get bored of whatever I am working on or am stuck. All I need to do is take a look at my list of project and I am sure to find one that interest me and then, off I go.

Having a project also gives you an anchor to connect ideas to. For example, I just read Salman Khan's book The one world schoolhouse. And, I vaguely have a project to improve one of the courses I am taking at uni. So I ended up interpreting/applying many of the ideas I saw in the book to this project. It helped motivate me to pay closer attention to the useful things. It helped me engage with the ideas, as I would think about how I could apply these, instead of just passively reading the book.
