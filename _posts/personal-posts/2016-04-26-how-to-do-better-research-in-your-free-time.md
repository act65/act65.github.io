These are my thoughts on how to motivate yourself to research interesting things, make meaningful insights into scientific conundrums and

The key seems to be to just clear your mind of attachments and expectations and just relax. Read a paper, have a play with some code. Often, if I have been doing the above, I will daydream about my research topics and have some insightful ideas.

Sometimes I find myself feeling;

- jealous. I feel behind where others are. I see younger people working for google, publishing meaningful and interesting papers.
- angry. Mainly at myself, for not understanding concepts quickly. For not having any good, revolutionary ideas.

I need to be more confident. To listen to supervisors, experts, professors... but to be bold enough to think that I know better.

I need to be more disciplined. I know that if I sit down and start reading a paper, I will probably be there for at least an hour, and I will be happy afterward. However, despite this knowledge I still watch youtube, scroll facebook etc...

I need to be more experimental. It is great coming up with ideas, but ideas are of no use to anyone. I need to test them.
