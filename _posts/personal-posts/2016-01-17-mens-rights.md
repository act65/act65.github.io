So, on average women earn 10-30% less than men in developed countries, but when you compare that to, the statistic that 80-95% of prisoners are male, it doesn't seem like a big deal. Maybe we should be talking about mens rights?

Now, an obvious argument against this (I welcome more as I couldn't think of many) would be that, the reason so many men are incarcerated is that many of their crimes are against women (rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence etc...). 

I think that there are two victims in a rape. Obviously the raped, but also the rapist. I think that if our society was better structured to support low status males (who represent the majority of criminals) and help them understand, and control, their libido, and help them deal with status anxiety (which males seem to suffer from) we could have avoided this whole situation. Thus, the rapist and raped are victims of the poor planning and systems put in place. One is branded a rapist and has set the course of their life, the other is raped...

The main point I am trying to make here is that, men are the problem. And that maybe we should focus on helping men out. And if men had less issues the world would be a better place.
