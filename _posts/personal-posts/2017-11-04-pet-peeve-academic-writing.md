(_have been writing up my full year project and needed to vent_)

As far as I have seen, academic writing boring, passive and lifeless. And over-sold, indulgent and egotistical. (Probably) The result of two supposedly good reasons; to emphasize the objectivity of the work done and to avoid bias in judgement. However, I think they are bollocks.

Science is meant to be objective, and we shouldn't base our evaluation on who did the experiments, or came up with the good ideas. Thus we use the passive voice, to divorce the researcher from the more important facts (We proved XXX vs XXX was proved) However, I think science is far more subjective than many researchers would like to admit. A proof can be subjective from the point of view that not everyone agrees with the assumptions. Experiments can be inconclusive, maybe there was a hyperparameter you didn't tune that could have made the algorithm work or an uncontrolled variable that you missed. The active voice can be used to remind readers that I am claiming XXX, and not that XXX is true. I think objective writing should be reserved for the things we really are sure about, and not the latest brain fart that you cleaned up with some paper.

A paper should be rated by its academic merits. Not by who wrote it, how entertaining it was, how easy it was to read, ... However, I think this argument (as it is commonly interpreted) is flawed in a couple of ways. There is a fallacy that bias is removed by boringness and that academic merit is the only metric we should be measuring papers by.

To remove bias  all papers should be of equivalent style, this does not mean that they should all be boring... If everyone wrote entertaining and engaging papers there would a similar chance for bias due to style. Why should we have to write boring crap to accommodate the others who cannot be bothered?

Papers can be contributions to science without necessarily discovering new truths. Explanation and popularisation, reframing and connecting, replication and validation, are all legitimate and worthwhile contributions. And yet they seem to have no place in academic writing.
