Currently, the problem with collecting tax is that it is easy for rich people to hide their income, wealth, assets. So, a question is;

> how can we design an incentive for rich people to accurately report (each other's) finances.

A potential solution (inspired by ancient Athenians -- I can't remember where I heard this, soz) is to rank people from richest to poorest. The higher your rank ( ie the richer you are ) more tax you have to pay.

The hope is that: for Gale, who is in the top 0.1%, changing his position by a (couple of) ranks is worth millions dollars. This gives Gale an incentive to allocate money towards uncovering the wealth of others within the top 0.1%, in the hope that he discovers their wealth. Resulting in a lower rank for Gale and less tax.

From a computatioal point of view, this idea is quite interesting. Using this solution, the govt only needs to verify info, not collect it ( which is where rich people choose the fight ).

A problem? Effectively, we have put the costs of doing tax audits on the public. But, what right does the public have to a private individuals financial information?
