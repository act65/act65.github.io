Walking around in my underwear thinking I was going to be the only person at Boulder lake hut. Helicopter with tourists drops by for 10 mins.

Flooded track

Boulder lake. Was very glad to see this, the track is not the best, and rather precarious in places.

Blue lake. Went swimming in it although I found out later that it isnt allowed... opps. Probably the coldest water I have ever been in.

Lake Rotoroa


I am not sure what I hoped to get out of the trip, but I didn't find it particularly relaxing or exciting. I spent some time feeling guilty and stressed that I was lounging around and not studying. And the rest reading various books and stories.
