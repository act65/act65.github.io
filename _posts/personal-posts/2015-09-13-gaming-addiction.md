**My story.**

Why do I game? I game because I want to forget about the issues in the world that make me unhappy. Recently I did some reading about politics, which got me very depressed (if you are interested in learning some depressing truths read Noam Chomsky). I also visited India, which was hard. I though I was a good person, but now I realise that I am not. I have found that caring for others is just too hard. So to ignore/distract myself from the fact that thousands of people are being murdered or starve to death or just generally suffering ... I distract myself with video games.

**Step 1**: Honesty

I have a problem. I cannot control myself when it comes to playing computer games."Tomorrow I will play less". I try to limit myself, I want to change, but I don't.  I play anywhere from 7-14 hours a day.

I do not take part in any other aspect of life other than gaming, and thus it has had a detrimental effect on my friendships and relationships, my health and cognitive powers, my happiness.

I am not happy.

**Step 2**: Hope

It is possible to change.

**Step 3**: Faith

I will fix this problem. I have control over myself, and I will make choices that make me happy.

**Step 4**: Courage

I fear that I will have a boring life. That I will do nothing that I value.

I fear being unhappy and depressed.

I resent others who are happy. They are not dealing with the same things I am currently. Self-doubts, meaninglessness, isolation, death and freedom. They don't understand.

**Step 5**: Integrity (_action_ - tell someone else about my problem)

I keep the extent of my gaming a secret from my friends, thus I feel ashamed and guilty when I talk to them. I feel inadequate and like a failure.

**Step 6**: Willingness (to change)

I want to be a motivated, excited person. Someone who has focus and a purpose to what they do. Who works hard for something greater than themselves.

**Step 7**: Humility

I am not perfect, and I never will be. But I can try.  I will always have flaws. Sometimes I wont get out of bed when I should, sometimes I will make mistakes, but that is normal.

**Step 8, 9, 10, 11, 12**: Not useful.

Video game free since 13/10/15. Four months of my life were just spent playing Guildwars2.

 

Notes on the 12 step process 

- It is pretty crap.
- It relies heavily on some external power coming in and helping (generally a god). These people should be looking into themselves for the strength. They/You are the problem.
- This is a process for changing peoples behaviour, is this the best way? What about one for saner scientific minds?
