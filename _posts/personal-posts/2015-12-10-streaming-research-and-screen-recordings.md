It is often hard to see what you have achieved in a day of coding and research. It is common to stumble into a problem that takes hours to solve, or to spend hours reading trying to understand a new concept.

I have recently found that a good solution to this is to record your screen and watch it back at 10-30x. Much like programmers do for Ludum Dare. This gives you a nice sense of accomplishment, which is especially nice for the times you have little to show for your work.

We could take this further and, like gamers on Twitch, we could live stream our research. What if people like Steven Pinker, Noam Chomsky, Geoffrey Hinton, Stephen Hawking... streamed their research? How many people would be interested in following and possibly even contributing, how much could others learn from witnessing their thought process?

Also, it is a great way to review your thought process when tackling problems.
