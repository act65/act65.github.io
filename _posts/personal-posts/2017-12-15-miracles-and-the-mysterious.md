For every pseudoscientific, hoax, miracle, ... there is a reason that people believe these things. In my opinion this reason is generally worth looking into as it has taught us a lot about human nature, and occasionally about the world around us.

Religion has taught us about how people need meaning, purpose, how thinking for yourself is hard and it is easier to follow someone else's word, it has also shown us the need for people to believe in something greater than themselves.

So, if we cannot come up with a compelling reason for a person to make believe, then maybe we should investigate the scientific merits of the claim? For example, if we consider people who claim to see ghosts. Ghosts existed this could mean that we have spirits, and thus when you die, you don't truly die. This is a convenient belief as death is a scary thought, and thus the belief tells us something about how believers think and their values. In this case, life is important and sacred, friends are to special to have died, ...

The point is that where most 'rational' people would be tempted to dismiss the mysterious, they are missing an interesting opportunity to learn about people.
