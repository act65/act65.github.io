It occurred to me that the reasons many people believe in evolution could be just as illogical, or even more so, than the reasons people believe in god or creationism.

It would be interesting to do a survey of people believing in evolution and creationism respectively and compare the reasons they cite for their belief.

My main point is that many people may believe in evolution because; they are told that it is logical and scientific, it is the trendy thing to do, it is fun to look down on others and call them ignorant, everyone they know does. Where they believe the theory, without understanding any of the evidence and how that evidence validates the theory. Believing a theory, with out any understanding or evidence, is same as faith, or believing in a god.

So to those who take a intellectual high-ground against those who believe in creationism, I ask you to rethink your reasons and logic for believing evolution. What is your understanding of the evidence and how does that show that evolution actually occurred? And to those who believe in creationism I ask the same.

This problem is far greater than those who believe in creationism. Peoples beliefs are easily influenced by those around them, their cultural environment.Â We need to encourage all people to understand their logical biases and to think critically, logically and scientifically. We should not tell people that they are wrong, ignorant and stupid because they believe the wrong thing. We should tell them they are wrong, ignorant and stupid because they don't have a logical and rigorous thought process.
