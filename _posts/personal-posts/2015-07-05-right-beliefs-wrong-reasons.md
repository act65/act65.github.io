It occurred to me that the reasons many people believe in evolution could be just as illogical than the reasons people believe in creationism (and / or god).

My main point is that many people may believe in evolution because; they are told that it is logical and scientific, it is the trendy thing to do, it is fun to look down on others and call them ignorant, everyone they know believes in it. Where they believe the theory, without understanding any of the evidence and how that evidence validates the theory. Believing a theory, with out any understanding or evidence, is same as faith.

So to those who take a intellectual high-ground against those who believe in creationism, I ask you to rethink your reasons and logic for believing evolution. What is your understanding of the evidence and how does that show that evolution actually occurred? And to those who believe in creationism I ask the same.

This problem is far greater than those who believe in creationism, or evolution. People's beliefs are easily influenced by those around them, their cultural environment.Â We need to encourage all people to understand their logical biases and to think critically, logically and scientifically. To value evidence. We should not tell people that they are wrong, ignorant and stupid because they believe the wrong thing. We should tell them they are wrong, ignorant and stupid because they don't have a logical and rigorous thought process.
