So, I had an idea for a short story. And I thought I would be interesting to blog about my progress along the way. To help me organise, plan and motivate the story.

Something I have noticed already. I am not used to the uncertainty of writing, and I didn't know how to deal with it. I assumed my experience in other areas would help me deal with this uncertainty but it doesn't seem to have helped. Hmm, domain transfer?

## The idea: Transcendence

Like humans are to genes (a vehicle for them to achieve their goals: replication), robots and programs are to humans (a vehicle for us/humans to achieve our goals). What happens when the vehicle starts to do what benefits it, rather than its creators? (so in these two circumstances that translates into rationality and apocalyptic AI)

Wait a minute. Corporations are also vehicles for humans to achieve their goals. We constrain/incentivise/control them with rules, constitutions, bureaucracy... What would happen if a corporation started making decisions for itself rather than humans, or even the people who run it. (E.g. climate change) Oh... It's already happening.

So this would be about rule setting, incentives, goals, designing reinforcement learning schemes and rewards. And some thinking about how we as humans could transcend them, and how this may happen with robots and corporations, aka AI.

## Structure

My first thought has been to split this into three interweaving stories and an essay.

#### Genes-humans.

This part would follow some average person, who makes mistakes, has biases... etc. I would be trying to show the idea that we as humans need to transcend their/our evolutionary programming as it often harms us. If (some aspects of) our programming had its way we would; be obese, cause over population, kill each other, value short term rewards... Oh... Nevermind.

I want to set up transcending our evolutionary programming (rationality) as a kind of enlightenment. A good thing.

#### Humans-Robots

This part would follow some students or a research team. They would be designing robots, programs. They would be frustrated with their robot (on Mars) as it isnt doing what they wanted. The begin dissecting the reasons for this, they made it too smart.

I also had the idea for a nice metaphor, but I dont know where to include it. Imagine a giant robot, and inside people controlled the legs, arms, made decisions about what it should do etc... And when the robot got old and broken, they people would simply get out and jump in a new one. (I want people to see the connection between genes-humans, humans-algorithms)

#### The AI we fear is already here (corporations)

Oh crap, its already here and it is murdering people. A dystopia (haha) of corporations. Where they are out of control, doing what suits them, without regard for the people they were created by.

#### Essay

And finally an essay (or two?) discussing some of the realities of this problem. How corporations are self serving (maybe some examples - climate change, war profiteering ...) and not making choices that benefit people. And a think about some of the ways that incentives/rewards can go awry.
