So I have been doing some 'research' as part of my studies and I have realised that it has been a bit different from what I do myself. I find myself; getting caught up in the latest fad, reading many papers about recent innovations - ResNets..., feeling a need to pick a publishable topic to investigate, trying to impress others with what I think they will find impressive, ...

> Research is not re-searching.

I think this captures the idea nicely. Although what professors/academics do is often called 'research', I think it is (or at least should be) closer to creation, exploration and discovery. And it shouldn't be the endless search through others work for existing ideas, aka re-search, it should be the creation, exploration and discovery of new ideas.

I think this is especially important now that science has become soo big. There are probably thousands of other researchers in your subfield and keeping up is a daunting challenge. But if we look at the past, it is easy to see that the majority of research has little to say. So don't worry yourself.

This is not to say that you shouldn't build on recent work, just to point out that feeling productive, reading lots of papers, even writing papers, ... isn't necessarily 'research' to me.
