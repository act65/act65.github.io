So after wanting to do a PhD for a few years (I am still making my way there, slowly) I finally questioned: what if I don't?

**DIY PhD.** Keep doing the same thing. Skim papers, tinker with code, chill out with textbooks, stare at math, ... Hmm, but I will need to support myself financially. Stay at home to cut costs. I could; tutor at Uni, do work part time in data science, get better at piano, ... I would need to get more involved in the SE / twitter /... community to make connections and discuss ideas.

**The internet.** Try to make some money off the internet; blog posts explaining ideas, write books on interesting topics, data science consultant.

**Work.** There are many interesting problems that come out of managing ML at scale.

But this begs the question. What is a PhD? And what is it for? 3 years of focused thought, while being supervised... Is it possible for me to focus for 3 years?

Having this plan (if you can call it that) helps take some of the pressure off having a good CV (for PhD applications) and allows me to research, rather than appearing to research...
