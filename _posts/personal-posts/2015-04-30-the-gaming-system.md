There are games for dealing with flight stress. There are games for chronic pain. There are games get over depression... and to motivate anyone to do almost anything (_running - FitBit, cleaning - ChoreWars, education - Quest to learn, real world problem solving - Evoke ... etc_). But what if, in the future, a certain set of games are not allowed or censored? How would people motivate themselves to do those things? For by then self-motivation would be a long lost art.

I am imagining a dystopia where everyone is living in a Totalitarian state but they enjoy it (_a kind of synthesis of 1984 and Brave New World_). This state is ruled by the game designers. It is not a stretch to think that game designers can expand their motivational powers to more domains: physical labor, sales, creativity ... (_especially considering the upcoming virtual reality games and advances in neuroscience - games hack into our 'happy' drugs, that is why they are addictive_).

And it has begun. How many people do you think are already addicted? Everyone is slowly being enslaved, and we won't/can't even see it coming, we will be too busy playing games.
