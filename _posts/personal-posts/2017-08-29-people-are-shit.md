Lately I have been struggling with a kind of contradiction and it has been effecting my mental health.

After learning about; cogntive biases, the 2008 finincial collapse, the haves and have-nots in third world countries, Trump, Exxon Mobil's doubt campaign, homeopathy, ... it seems obvious that people are myopic, selfish, and willfully ignorant. Even worse, it seems unlikely we can change this ourselves. It was hardwired into us by evolution.

I love the idea of improving myself and humanity as a whole. Currently, my favourite approach to fixing our thought processes is brain-uploading. After we upload, it could give us the ability to tinker with our own brains; removing out-of-date heuristics and even adding some new capabilities. However, in the mean time the problem remains.

I often find myself lamenting others lack of control over themselves and disliking myself because I am no better. I am just another human, who has inherited all the unfortunate traits of our shared evolutionary past. Over-confidence, irrationality, xenophobia, powerlust, wishful thinking...

Disliking the way we (humans) think is what drives me to want to improve us, but it also means I often dislike myself. I find this hard.
