When I first arrived I felt pretty uncomfortable, but I guess 24 hours travelling, eating new foods and at irregular times will do that. On my first night I ran into some trouble finding somewhere to stay. The Youth Hostel I planned to stay at wasn't open. So I quickly learnt that I had to either end up in a mess or get my hands dirty. After that things started to flow nicely. The Indian people were very happy to help and I was reminded that many hands make light work. While in Chennai, I found that things we occasionally a bit forced and I had to give it bit of a push. As of now, I have yet to make my big splash.

If you didn't realise earlier this was about my first few days in India while I was having a few problems "Blowing The Butt Trumpet", or "Letting The Toilet Know Who's Boss", or "Carbo-unloading". Thankyou for reading...
