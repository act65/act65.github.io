I have glimpsed a distant feeling, one that worries me. I might not be open minded as I think. This worries me as I value learning lessons from others; understanding how you think and seeing how I might be wrong.

My favourite definition of open-mindedness so far is " _the willingness to take a novel viewpoint seriously_" (Jack Kwong). Also, the definition below is fun;

So, how can I be more open minded?

I am not sure of the best solution, but I have an idea for a game.

1. Player 1 picks a book and assigns the book to Player 2.
2. Player 2 reads the book.
3. The players swap places and Goto 1.

Conditions:

- you must have read the book you are assigning
- the book must be easily available (preferably in a library, or cost less than $40)
- the book must be easily readable (in English, not a textbook, not > 500 pages)

In part, this idea was inspired by a quote from 1984, _"The best books... are those that tell you what you know already"_. In my mind, I have rephrased this quote to: _"we like/pick books that agree with us"_. I am hopeful that open-mindedness is a defense against confirmation bias, our tendency to see what we want to see. I want to burst my own bubble. Pop!

Another part was inspired by my struggle (or is it universal?) to recommend books to others. When buying a book for someone, I have tried to think of a book that the unfortunate target might like, one that aligns with their values and interests. And certainly, if I were better at empathising, and actively engaged in my friends/families lives, this task would be easier, and I would have had more success. But I think there is more to be gained from reading someone else's favourite story, the stories they tell themselves (rather than what they think I would be interested in).

And the rest is motivated by my want to force others to read books that I like. I want to share my interests with others, but often feels inappropriate to push my values onto others. How can I con people into giving my interests a chance?

Cool. My turn first! Let's start with a low barrier to entry: a short story called [The truth of fact, the truth of feeling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18455800-the-truth-of-fact-the-truth-of-feeling?from_search=true) by Ted Chiang (author of Arrival, amongst other things). You can find an online version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140222103103/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang). If you finish it, it's your turn, I will read a book of your choosing.

Note to self: Depending on how well this goes, it might be sensible to extend this to other types of media; movies and documentaries, blog posts, games...?
