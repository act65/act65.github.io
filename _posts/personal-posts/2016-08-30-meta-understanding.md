How well do (I think) I understand #@$\*&(#%   ? Note that I am not asking; how well I remember #\*$\*%\*@$&, or whether I can list technical terms or facts about #$&\*$#@($, or whether I have a high paying job to do #$\*$&(\*#@. Which are the typical substitutions we make when asking ourselves this difficult question (Kahneman had a name for this?!?).

So, what is the difference between understanding and not-understanding? Understanding requires a story explaining connections, a story of causes and effects, of reasons (rather than correlations and similarities), understanding can explain why. (but it isnt that simple, there are restrictions on the sorts of stories we can tell?) Alternatively, understanding can be used; to make (accurate) predictions or to further extend.

What requirements are there of there explanations? Following from the philosophy of science, they should probably be falsifiable and specific.

And maybe we can go even further: you do not understand it unless;

- you can reconstruct it,
- you can teach it to others (successfully),
- you can extend it/contribute/improve.

### Calculus

I know the definition of a finite difference, of chain rule, of partial derivatives, of a jacobian and hessian, ... But; why that definition for a finite difference? How does finite (empirical) differentiation relate to symbolic differentiation? Why is it that dual numbers capture chain rule (automatic differentiation) relation so nicely? I don't know.

Understanding: 3/10

### Linear Algebra

A vector can be interpreted as a direction (or arrow), starting from the origin to the point defined by the vector. Why is that useful or interesting? Why does SVD keep popping up everywhere? Orthogonality seems super important, a strong assumption, that dimensions are independent. What if we relax this?

Understanding: 4/10

Note: _Ok, just doing a couple of these I can already see how little I understand ideas I thought I did. More to come later (hopefully)._

### (meta (meta (understanding)))

What habits can I use to help me monitor my understand?

- One of the most dangerous things you can ever tell yourself is _"I think I understand"._ So try to catch yourself doing it and ask yourself whether you really do understand.
