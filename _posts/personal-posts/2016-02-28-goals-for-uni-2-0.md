What do I want to get out of my second attempt at University?

- (Learn to) Cultivate a deep sense of enjoyment and content from learning, being curious and playing with ideas.
- To actively manage my motivation and to draw it from sustainable places (learn because you are curious)
- To make some like minded friends, ones that I can count on for interesting ideas and, conversely, a sounding board for ideas I think are interesting.
- To learn new tools for thinking and analysis (math) and collaboration (leadership and followership)
- To gain a deeper understanding of cognition (cognitive sciences, neural networks, ?)

Things I don't want getting in the way.

- The feeling that I need to 'succeed' and work hard
- Others expectations of what I should be doing
- Comparisons to other students
