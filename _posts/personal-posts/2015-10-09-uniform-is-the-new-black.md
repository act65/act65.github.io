What if everyone wore and had the same clothes and basic possessions, **uniformity**? Does personal choice in clothing, the diversity of clothing, lead to prejudice and discrimination? Now you make the argument, what about expressing your individuality? But how effective are clothes at expressing your **individuality**?

Stereotyping

The uniformity of clothes means that people can no longer judge you by the clothes you wear. Instead they must to get to know you, have some sort of interaction, before they can judge you, it suspends judgement. And I hope that this suspension will break down some of the barriers to meeting new people and making friends outside of your usual circles, as premature judgment is literally prejudice.

_“You are a rich white boy right? Do you think that I would know, who you are, your family struggles, your personal daemons, how hard your life has been, just because I saw you wearing some expensive sunglasses, a polo shirt and jeans?”_ \- A modified version of a quote from Good Will Hunting.

It seems ironic that clothes and possessions are meant to express your individuality, yet they are one of the main facilitators of stereotyping, where your individuality is removed, you are assigned a 'box’ to fit into. Does that ‘box’ define you?

Prejudice and discrimination are an artifact of the way our brain adapted to cope with threats and opportunities in our early days (cavemen) in the wilderness. They are heuristic shortcuts designed for quick reaction speed, not accuracy. An ideal adaption then, but maybe this shortcut is less relevant now.

Status Discrimination

Clothes and possessions are generally used as a measure of material wealth, thus making clothing uniform could remove barriers between the rich and poor. Hopefully, this would lead to more friends being made between classes, and thus more empathy shared between classes.

The lack of status has been linked to violent crime, so if the status of others was less clear would this reduce violent crime?

So how do we remove this prejudice and discrimination, either we can teach people to be aware of their own biases, or we can remove the source, clothes. Naked!!! (Am I saying that diversity leads to discrimination???)

Satisfying our need for pride

If people can not gain status from appearance, what would/could they do to get status?

_"Imagine if we all wore the same clothes, lived in the same sort of house and drove the same sort of car. Social scientists ponder this at length. Our deep seated need for recognition, our vanity and pride - how would it be satisfied? Would we try to stand out from the pack through eloquence and knowledge, or would we command respect by what we contributed, rather than what we extracted?"_ (Quoted from Alternative Hedonism, p25, in the NewPhilosopher #6 - Progress
