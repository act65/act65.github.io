I have a test tomorrow on topology. I want to do another test on my ability to delude (myself). I want to make a prediction now - about how prepared I am, how much I have learnt and how well I think I will do - so that I can compare it against the results. The aim is to see whether (or more likely, how much) I have deluded myself.

### Predictions

Grade = 80% +/- 10%. No, fundamental misconceptions, but some simple mistakes and errors or small parts I didn't consider important/missed when studying. Also, I possibly ran out of time because I am having to derive things from scratch.

### Likely ways I have deluded myself

- I have convinced myself that I understand concepts, but really, I only know their names and definitions.
- I looked at a previous test and convinced myself that I would have received a high mark.
- Look at practice questions and conclude that they are easy, without actually completing the problems, and receiving feedback.
- Attempt practice questions, while using wikipedia, model answers, stackexchange, ... etc and after getting them correct, conclude that you must know the material.

### Adversarial learning

A potential solution? Imagine that your teachers goal is for every student to get the lowest possible mark, 0%, while still sticking to material that has been taught, which is relatively debatable. How would you study? Is this how you should always study?

 

Or maybe this was just an interesting excuse to procrastinate...
