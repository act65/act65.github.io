Notes on Peter Singer [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168483-the-most-good-you-can-do).

I think Effective Altruism/Peter Singer conflates to distinct ideas, empathy and rationality. Rationality help you achieve goals in a effective way, and in this case our goal should be guided by empathy.

I hadn't considered research into existential risks as the most good you/I can do, but now you mention it, it makes sense. Depending on how you measure 'good'...

One problem that I always come up against is argument is: Humans are good at rationalising their beliefs. How sure can we be that we are trying to do the most good we can rather than justifying whatever interests we already have.

Also, does it matter if you help other to make yourself feel good, or that you do it because you truly care? It just seems somewhat fragile if we are doing it to please ourselves, like we could change our mind on a whim.
