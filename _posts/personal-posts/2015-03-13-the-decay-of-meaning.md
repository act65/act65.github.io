As we, or maybe it's just me, can see from Shakespeare's near unreadable and confusing prose (see below), language changes over time.

"Look thou be true; do not give dalliance Too ... much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious, Or else, good night your vow!" (Act IV, Scene I, The Tempest)

I am interested in word meanings changing over time - also known as semantic change.

Some good examples are;

- Gay. Back in the 13th century the word meant “light-hearted” or “joyous” and a century later it meant “bright and showy”. But in the 1630s it acquired connotations of immorality with the term “Gay woman” meaning prostitute or “gay house” a brothel. It was first used to refer to homosexuality in the 1930s.
- Cute. Cute was a shortened form of acute, meaning “keenly perceptive and shrewd” in the 1730s. But by the 1830s it was part of American student slang, meaning “pretty, charming and dainty”.
- Awful. In the 1300s it originally meant “inspiring wonder” and was a short version of “full of awe”. But now the word has purely negative connotations.

So my question is, what is this post going to say in 50-100 years? Certainly not what I intended, considering that if I called some an awfully cute gay, while these words retained their original meanings, it would mean someone who is inspiring, smart and happy.

Some other question I have: Is the rate of semantic change accelerating, decelerating and remaining constant? How has the internet changed the rate of semantic change? Are all of our discoveries, works of art, scientific papers ... doomed to decay into meaninglessness or to be replaced by future editions?

Wouldn't it be cool if there was some sort of app/program that updated old texts/out of date texts (or vocal/imagery?) with the most recent semantic changes - a translator, from old to new/current? Ensuring that what we write today is just as hip and readable as what is written and read by those in the future.
