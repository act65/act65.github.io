> What experiments could I do at home that would prove (to even the most skeptical) that our actions are causing a change in climate?

If I measure the amount of heat absorbed by CO2 in my bedroom with an IR sprectrometer. Does that prove that CO2 is responsible for global warming? No. I mean, where does CO2 come from anyway?

If I collect the exhaust gases from burning gasoline. And determine the amount of CO2 released with a bicarbonate indicator. This could tell me the amount of CO2 produced by running my car on gasoline. But does this imply that humans are causing climte change? No. Anyway, don't plants absorb CO2?

If I collect data; temperature, rainall, humidity, atmospheric CO2 concentration, for the next 50 years. And see a positive correlation between temperature and CO2 concentration. Does this prove anthropogenic climate change? No. Correlation does not imply causation.

> The point is. It is not really possible for a skeptical individual to prove anthopogenic climate change. Although it is easy to disprove. _If any of the experiments above fail, then anthropogenic climate change is unlikely to be true._

If CO2 doesn't absorb large amounts of infrared radiation, then it cannot act as a greenhouse gas, and will not heat the planet.

If burning gasoline doesn't release CO2 then the attribution of human activitiy as the cause of global warming is tenuous.

Causation does imply correlation. So if there was no correlation between CO2 and temperature, then we can disprove anthropogenic climate change.

> So then, what evidence do we have for anthropogenic climate change? (that cannot be easily gathered by an individual)

Historical data from ice cores and geological samples telling us about Earth's climate tens of thousands of years ago, before humans were up to much. This data tells us the 'natural' range of global temperature, which we can compare to now.

Our knowledge of the effects of many physical processes, solar flares, volcanoes, ... which allows us to remove these as confounders of a correlation between temperature and CO2 released by humans, us. Meaning, we can, with more certainty, claim a causal relationship between CO2 release (via say burning gasoline) and global temperature.

The lifetime of CO2 in our atmosphere. CO2 is absorbed by oceans, by trees, even by some rocks. But, we have studied the lifetime of CO2 in our atmosphere over decades, and now we know that it stays there.
