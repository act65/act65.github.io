> What experiments could I do at home that would prove (to even the most skeptical) that our actions are causing a change in climate?

If I measure the amount of heat absorbed by CO2 in my bedroom with an IR sprectrometer. Does that prove that CO2 is responsible for global warming? No. I mean, where does CO2 come from anyway?

If I collect the exhaust gases from burning gasoline. And determine the amount of CO2 released with a bicarbonate indicator. This could tell me the amount of CO2 produced by running my car on gasoline. But does this imply that humans are causing climate change? No. Why would a small amount of extra CO2 heat the atmosphere? And anyway, don't plants absorb CO2?

If I collect data; temperature, rainfall, humidity, atmospheric CO2 concentration, for the next 50 years. And see a positive correlation between temperature and CO2 concentration. Does this prove anthropogenic climate change? No. Correlation does not imply causation.

<!-- 1. **Ocean Acidification Experiment:** Materials needed would include two clear glass containers, tap water, pH test strips, a ruler, baking soda (representing carbonic acid formed when CO2 dissolves in water), a straw, and sea shells. Instructions: Fill both containers with the same amount of water and record the pH. Dissolve some baking soda in one container to lower the pH. Then drop seashells into both containers and observe what happens over the course of a week.

   This experiment gives a tangible demonstration of the effects of increased CO2 concentration on ocean life, a side-effect of anthropogenic climate change.

2. **Ice Melting Experiment:** Ice cubes, clear glass containers, different kind of materials (such as black paper, white paper, aluminum foil, etc.), and a sunny day are needed. The idea is to wrap ice cubes in different materials, expose them to sunlight, and observe how quickly they melt. 

    This is a simple, yet effective, demonstration of albedo - the reflective property of surfaces. Snow and ice have high albedo and reflect a lot of the sun's energy back into space, but as global warming continues and these surfaces melt, darker land and ocean surfaces are exposed, having a lower albedo and therefore absorbing more heat. This is a positive feedback loop that accelerates warming. -->

> The point is. It is not possible for a skeptical individual to prove anthopogenic climate change. Although it is easy to disprove. _If any of the experiments above fail, then anthropogenic climate change as we understand it is unlikely to be true._

- If CO2 doesn't absorb large amounts of infrared radiation, then it cannot act as a greenhouse gas, and will not heat the planet.
- If burning gasoline doesn't release CO2 then the attribution of human activitiy as the cause of global warming is tenuous.

Causation does imply correlation. So if there was no correlation between CO2 and temperature, then we can disprove anthropogenic climate change.

> So then, what evidence do we have for anthropogenic climate change? (that cannot be easily gathered by an individual)

1. Historical data from [ice cores](https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-cores/ice-core-basics/) and geological samples telling us about Earth's climate tens of thousands of years ago, before humans were up to much. This data tells us the 'natural' range of global temperature, which we can compare to now.

2. More recent data measuring [global temperature average](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/global-temperature-anomalies-graphing-tool), [ocean acidification](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ocean-heat), [atmospheric CO2 concentration](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide), [sea levels and ice sheet mass](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/global-mean-sea-level-graph), gathered by satellites and weather stations around the world tells us that the Earth is warming, and that this warming is correlated with the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

3. Our knowledge of the effects of many physical processes, solar flares, volcanoes, ... allows us to remove these as confounders of a correlation between temperature and CO2 released by humans, us. Meaning, we can, with more confidence, claim a causal relationship between CO2 release (via say burning gasoline) and global temperature.

4. We understand the lifetime of CO2 in our atmosphere. While CO2 is absorbed by oceans, by trees, even by some rocks, we understand the rate at which each process occurs. This allows us to predict the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere at any given time, and compare this to the amount of CO2 released by humans.
