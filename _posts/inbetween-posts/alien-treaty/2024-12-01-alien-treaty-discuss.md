## Motivation

In NZ there has recently been a lot of debate about the Treaty of Waitangi with the introduction of the [Treaty principles bill](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0094/latest/whole.html).
I read a [short book](https://www.bwb.co.nz/books/introducing-te-tiriti-o-waitangi?srsltid=AfmBOoqr7r6pUgFNf94844D4nnhphzk-H-2COHX7jrt72WCTvAGaTXq9) on the Treaty of Waitangi and I wanted to share / explore what I learned.
My goal here is to write a [sci-fi story]({{site.baseurl }}/alien-treaty/) that parallels (as much as possible) the treaty of Waitangi, the context it was drafted and its consequences.

## Discussion

This story draws inspiration from the Treaty of Waitangi and its impact on Māori people. However, the parallel is imperfect.
While the story portrays the Galactic Federation as well-meaning but culturally insensitive, the historical reality of colonial powers was far more severe. The British Crown and settlers often acted with deliberate malice, used military force, legal manipulation, and systematic oppression to dispossess Māori of their lands, language, and cultural identity.

<!-- That being said, (I believe) many British colonials earnestly thought they were bringing progress and civilization to "savage" lands. The story reflects this paternalistic attitude in the Federation's interactions with humanity. The Federation genuinely believes they are helping humans advance, but their methods erase cultural heritage and impose alien norms without regard for human values. -->


Key lessons / points I want to highlight:

- technology can influence / drive cultural change.
- a treaty means nothing if you can't enforce it.
- change is inevitable.
- colonialism is not always bad.
- systemic discrimination is subtle and resilient.
