## Generation Gap

At her nephew's wedding, Sarah notices there's no dancing - it's considered an inefficient use of energy. The ceremony is brief and practical, focused on the legal merger of assets and genetic compatibility assessment. The bride wears a "chromatic adjustment suit" that changes colors based on emotional readings rather than a traditional white dress. When Sarah suggests a toast, she's reminded that the new social efficiency guidelines recommend limiting ceremonies to 30 minutes. Most guests attend via neural link anyway.

A trendy new restaurant advertises "Evolution Cuisine." The human chef proudly demonstrates how she uses alien scanning technology to optimize flavor combinations and nutrient profiles. Traditional cooking methods are dismissed as "guesswork." When Sarah mentions her mother's secret recipe, the chef nods in polite disinterest. The other human diners eagerly consume their scientifically perfect meals while recording their biological responses for their health apps.

A local council debates removing the old town hall. Young human architects present sleek designs based on alien efficiency principles. When Sarah speaks up for preserving historical architecture, other humans dismiss her as "stuck in the past." One council member proudly mentions that his children don't even know what a church is - "We're finally moving beyond superstition." The vote isn't even close.

A "modern" wedding ceremony is conducted via neural network, with guests attending virtually. The couple proudly announces they've opted for a "rational partnership contract" with clear KPIs and a five-year review clause. Traditional vows are replaced with efficiency pledges. The bride's mother weeps - not from joy, but because her daughter chose to wear a temperature-regulating suit instead of her great-grandmother's wedding dress. "Mom, fabric is so... archaic."

Sarah watched her granddaughter Maya's fingers dance across the neural interface, her movements precise and practiced. The holographic display responded instantly, alien symbols cascading through the air. At thirteen, Maya was more fluent in Federation Standard than most adult humans.

"Grandmother, watch this!" Maya's eyes lit up as she manipulated the display. "Ven taught me a new way to modulate the quantum harmonics. It's so much more efficient than the old method."

Sarah forced a smile. "That's wonderful, dear." She glanced around Maya's room – sterile, minimalist, temperature-regulated to Federation standard. No posters, no books, no mess. Nothing like the chaotic, creative space a teenage girl's room used to be. Even the air smelled different, purified to alien specifications.

The door chimed, and Ven glided in. After twenty years, Sarah still couldn't quite get used to their fluid movement. "Maya, your progress is exemplary," Ven said, their voice carrying that familiar tone of measured approval. "Your neural plasticity scores are approaching Federation benchmarks."

Maya beamed. "Thank you, Mentor Ven. Will you tell me more about the Academy?"

"The Federation Youth Academy would be fortunate to have you," Ven replied. "Your generation understands the importance of efficiency and progress. Unlike..." They trailed off, glancing at Sarah.

"Unlike those of us who cling to outdated ways?" Sarah finished quietly.

Maya rolled her eyes, a gesture she'd picked up from old videos. "Grandmother, not everything from the past is worth keeping. The Federation way is better. More logical."

Sarah's chest tightened. She remembered Maya as a toddler, dancing to traditional Chinese music in the garden, making up stories about dragons and phoenixes. Now her granddaughter spent her free time studying Federation protocols and optimizing neural pathways.

"Maya, would you excuse us?" Sarah asked. "I need to speak with Ven privately."

Once Maya had left, Sarah turned to her old friend. "Do you remember when we first met, Ven? How we talked about cultural exchange, about bringing the best of both worlds together?"

"We've achieved that," Ven replied. "Look at Maya – she represents humanity's bright future."

"Does she? Because I see a child who knows more about Federation quantum mechanics than Earth's history. Who's never tasted her great-grandmother's dumplings because they're 'nutritionally inefficient.' Who thinks art is wasteful because it serves no practical purpose."

"Sarah," Ven's tone was gentle but firm, "you're allowing emotion to cloud your judgment. Maya has opportunities we could only dream of twenty years ago. The Federation has given humanity access to technologies that have eliminated disease, extended lifespans, opened up the galaxy—"

"At what cost?" Sarah interrupted. "When was the last time you saw children playing in the park? When did you last hear live music that wasn't computer-optimized? Even our languages are dying – everyone speaks Federation Standard now because it's more 'efficient' for neural interfaces."

"These are natural evolutionary steps," Ven said. "The Federation went through similar transitions. Change is inevitable."

Sarah walked to the window, looking out at the gleaming cityscape. The old neighborhoods had been replaced by uniform structures designed for optimal energy usage. Even the trees were engineered for maximum oxygen production.

"You know what Maya asked me yesterday? She wanted to know why humans used to waste time cooking when nutrient synthesis is more precise. She couldn't understand why anyone would choose to be 'inefficient.'" Sarah turned back to Ven. "That's not evolution, Ven. That's erasure."

"You're being dramatic," Ven replied, but there was a hint of uncertainty in their voice. "The treaty guaranteed preservation of human cultural heritage."

"The treaty guaranteed what you decided was worth preserving. Our museums are full of artifacts, but culture isn't just objects in display cases. It's lived experience. It's the messy, inefficient, beautiful way we choose to be human."

"Sarah..." Ven began, but she cut them off.

"Do you know what the worst part is? We did this to ourselves. I did this. I helped translate that treaty. I convinced people to sign it. I believed in your promises of progress and protection." Sarah's voice cracked. "I never thought protection meant protection from ourselves."

Ven was silent for a long moment. "The Federation's mandate is to advance civilizations we encounter. To help them reach their full potential."

"Their full potential as defined by Federation standards," Sarah replied bitterly. "Did you ever consider that we might have had our own path? Our own way of reaching our potential?"

"Your way was slower. Less efficient."

"Yes. And maybe that mattered. Maybe the journey was as important as the destination."

Maya's voice drifted through the door, speaking in perfect Federation Standard with another student. Sarah couldn't understand most of it – the language had evolved beyond her ability to keep up.

"I should check on Maya's progress," Ven said, moving toward the door. "The Academy applications are due soon."

Sarah watched them go, remembering the young diplomatic attaché who had once spent hours asking her about human poetry, who had seemed genuinely fascinated by the illogical beauty of metaphor. Now Ven spoke only of progress and efficiency.

Through the window, the sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange. Sarah wondered if Maya ever noticed the sunsets anymore, or if she only saw them as atmospheric light diffraction requiring optical adjustment. She wondered how many more generations it would take before no one remembered what it meant to simply stand and watch the sky change color, finding beauty in inefficiency.
