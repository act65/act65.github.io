In NZ there has recently been a lot of debate about the Treaty of Waitangi with the introduction of the [Treaty principles bill](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0094/latest/whole.html).
I read a [short book](https://www.bwb.co.nz/books/introducing-te-tiriti-o-waitangi?srsltid=AfmBOoqr7r6pUgFNf94844D4nnhphzk-H-2COHX7jrt72WCTvAGaTXq9) on the Treaty of Waitangi and I wanted to share / explore what I learned.
My goal here is to write a sci-fi story that parallels (as much as possible) the treaty of Waitangi, the context it was drafted and its consequences.

Disclaimers:

1. I wrote this with copious help from claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022.

2. This story draws inspiration from the Treaty of Waitangi and its impact on Māori people. However, the parallel is imperfect.
While the story portrays the Galactic Federation as well-meaning but culturally insensitive, the historical reality of colonial powers was far more severe. The British Crown and settlers often acted with deliberate malice, used military force, legal manipulation, and systematic oppression to dispossess Māori of their lands, language, and cultural identity.
