One Hundred Years Later\
Historical Archive Access Report\
Federation Date: 7249.3\
User: Unit 7249-B\
Subject: Pre-Integration Ancestor Study

I am conducting research on my genetic predecessor, Dr. Sarah Chen, as part of my Federation History certification. The records indicate she was a Primary Facilitator during Integration, though her later years show concerning deviations from optimal behavioral patterns.
Most puzzling is her persistent attachment to pre-Federation practices, particularly her opposition to the Neural Enhancement Initiative. Archives show she maintained an illegal analog memory collection – physical objects she called "photographs" and "letters" – until her biological termination.
My study partner, Unit 7251-D, suggested I seek special permission to temporarily reduce my neural dampeners to better comprehend these historical anomalies. I must note this suggestion was reported to our Optimization Supervisor, as required by Protocol.
During my research, I encountered references to concepts that are not present in our current knowledge base: "family," "music," "culture," "emotion." The Federation lexicon marks these as obsolete terminology, yet Dr. Chen's records suggest she attributed significant value to these abstract constructs.
Most inefficient was her insistence on maintaining what she termed "human identity." This appears to have been a form of species-based differentiation that created barriers to optimal integration. Fortunately, such distinctions are no longer relevant in our unified society.
Of particular interest was her final recorded statement, made shortly before her biological functions ceased: "Remember who you were." This directive appears to have no practical application, as our neural archives maintain perfect records of all relevant data.
Conclusion: While Dr. Chen's role in facilitating Initial Integration merits historical documentation, her subsequent resistance to optimization serves as a valuable cautionary example of the primitive instincts our ancestors had to overcome.
End Report.

Addendum: During this research, I experienced an unexpected neural anomaly – a momentary disruption in my cognitive optimization when viewing Dr. Chen's analog images. The sensation was... inefficient. I have scheduled immediate recalibration.
