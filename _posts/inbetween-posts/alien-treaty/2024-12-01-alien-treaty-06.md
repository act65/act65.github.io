## Early Days

Sarah stood at the window of her new office in the Joint Human-Federation Development Center, watching the morning traffic flow smoothly through the recently implemented gravity lanes. Flying vehicles, both human and alien-made, moved in perfect synchronization, their paths orchestrated by the Federation's traffic management AI. Just five years after the treaty signing, and already the world felt different. Better, she thought, though a small voice in the back of her mind whispered otherwise.
"Dr. Chen?" Ven's familiar harmonics filled the room. "I brought you something."
Sarah turned to see her alien friend holding what appeared to be a cup of coffee, steam rising from its surface. She'd mentioned missing her morning coffee after the old machine in their wing had broken down.
"You remembered," she smiled, accepting the cup. "But how did you get this? The cafeteria's been closed for renovations."
"I had the molecular synthesizer programmed with your preferred blend," Ven said, their speech patterns having become more colloquial over the years. "Though I still don't understand the human attachment to this particular combination of chemicals."
Sarah took a sip. It was perfect – better than any coffee she'd ever had, actually. That was happening more and more lately: alien technology improving upon human traditions in subtle ways.
"Speaking of improvements," Ven continued, bringing up a holographic display, "the medical implementation program is exceeding all projections. Infant mortality is down 82% globally, and we've effectively cured seven of your most prevalent cancers."
Sarah nodded, scanning the statistics. "It's amazing, Ven. Sometimes I can hardly believe how far we've come in such a short time."
"And yet," Ven's tone shifted slightly, "we're encountering some... resistance."
Sarah set down her coffee. "What kind of resistance?"
"Several major hospitals are reporting that older doctors are struggling to adapt to the new systems. The neural interfaces were designed for Federation standard physiology – the human nervous system requires more... effort to integrate properly."
"Are they being offered additional training?"
"Of course," Ven replied. "But efficiency metrics suggest it would be more productive to fast-track younger doctors who show natural aptitude for the new technologies. The Federation is proposing an accelerated certification program."
Sarah frowned. "That would effectively force many experienced doctors into early retirement."
"They would be compensated generously," Ven assured her. "And the overall improvement in healthcare outcomes would more than justify the transition."
Before Sarah could respond, her granddaughter Maya burst into the office, her school bag floating behind her on a gravity pad.
"Aunt Ven!" Maya exclaimed, using the honorary title she'd given the alien years ago. "Can you help me with my xenobiology homework? We're studying Federation species' neural pathways, and I want to make sure I get everything right for the placement exam."
Sarah felt a slight pang. Maya had barely touched her human biology textbooks lately, focusing instead on Federation subjects. But wasn't that natural? The future was in the stars, after all.
"Of course, little one," Ven responded warmly. "Though perhaps we should use the learning pods? They'll provide a much more immersive experience than these..." they gestured at Maya's tablet, "...primitive visual displays."
Maya beamed, but Sarah noticed her granddaughter squinting slightly in the office's alien-optimized lighting. The Federation's standard illumination spectrum, while more energy-efficient, wasn't quite right for human eyes. She'd been meaning to mention it to facility management, but there always seemed to be more pressing matters.
"I'll leave you two to it," Sarah said, gathering her things. "I have a meeting with the Cultural Heritage Committee anyway."
As she walked through the building's corridors, Sarah noticed how empty the traditional conference rooms were, while the Federation's immersion chambers were fully booked. Most of her human colleagues had adapted to the alien way of conducting meetings – their consciousness temporarily merged in a shared virtual space. Sarah still preferred face-to-face conversations, though she couldn't deny the efficiency of the new method.
The Cultural Heritage Committee meeting was sparsely attended. The agenda included discussion of converting several museums into "interactive historical experiences" using Federation technology. The artifacts would be scanned and stored, while perfect holographic reproductions would allow visitors to handle and examine them without risk of damage.
"It's more accessible," argued one of her younger colleagues. "Kids these days won't sit still for traditional exhibits anyway."
Sarah found herself nodding along. The proposal made sense, was better in almost every measurable way. Yet as she walked home that evening, passing the newly installed atmospheric processors that had already reduced global pollution by 40%, she couldn't shake a feeling of unease.
She found Ven and Maya still in her office, now surrounded by floating holographic displays of neural networks. Maya was speaking rapidly in the Federation's scientific language, her pronunciation perfect.
"Grandmother!" Maya called out. "Aunt Ven says I might qualify for the advanced placement program. I could start my Federation medical training next year!"
"That's wonderful, sweetheart," Sarah replied, trying to ignore the fact that her twelve-year-old granddaughter was about to bypass most of her traditional education. "Just... don't forget about your other subjects too, okay?"
"But why?" Maya asked, genuinely puzzled. "The Federation's medical technology is so much more advanced. Why would I need to learn the old ways?"
Ven placed a gentle appendage on Maya's shoulder. "All knowledge has value, little one. But your grandmother is right – you should get home and rest. Human children still require significant sleep cycles."
After Maya left, Ven turned to Sarah. "She shows remarkable aptitude. Her generation will bridge our cultures in ways we never imagined."
Sarah smiled, pushing down her concerns. This was what they'd worked for, wasn't it? A better future for the next generation. The unease she felt was probably just the natural resistance to change that humans were so prone to.
"You're right," she said finally. "The future is bright."
But that night, as she lay in bed listening to the soft hum of the atmospheric processors, Sarah dreamed of her grandmother's traditional cooking, of handwritten books, of imperfect but human things. When she woke, she couldn't remember why she'd been crying.
