## First Light

Dr. Sarah Chen stared at the pattern of signals on her monitor, her coffee growing cold beside her keyboard. The same sequence repeated every 127 seconds with perfect precision. Too perfect.

"It's not random noise," she muttered, more to herself than to her colleague across the desk. "And it's definitely not one of ours."
The cramped office in Berkeley's SETI department had become her second home over the past week, ever since the first anomalous signal had been detected by radio telescopes across the globe.

"Could be a pulsar," suggested Dr. Martinez, though his tone suggested he didn't believe it either.
Sarah shook her head, tucking a strand of black hair behind her ear. "Pulsars don't modulate their signals like this. This has structure. Look at these recurring patterns - they're like morphemes in a language, but nothing I've ever seen before."

Her fingers flew across the keyboard, applying another analysis algorithm she'd written the night before. The screen filled with new visualizations, mathematical representations of the signal's structure. After fifteen years of computational linguistics, she'd developed an intuition for patterns in communication, whether human or machine. This was something else entirely.

"If it is a language," Martinez said carefully, "what do you think they're saying?"

Before Sarah could answer, her phone buzzed. Then Martinez's. Then every phone in the building seemed to go off simultaneously. The sound of running footsteps echoed in the hallway outside.

"Turn on the news," someone shouted from the corridor.

Martinez grabbed the remote and flicked on the small TV mounted in the corner of their office. Every channel showed the same image: a crisp, geometric shape hanging in the sky above Shanghai. Similar objects had appeared over New York, London, Moscow, and a dozen other major cities.
"Well," Sarah said, her voice barely a whisper, "I guess we don't need to decode their signal anymore."

The next forty-eight hours passed in a blur of emergency meetings, military briefings, and endless attempts to establish communication. Sarah found herself pulled from her university position into a hastily assembled international task force, her expertise in computational linguistics suddenly vital to humanity's future.

The aliens - there was no other word for them - maintained their positions above Earth's major cities but took no hostile action. Their ships, if that's what they were, simply hung there like geometric abstractions against the sky, broadcasting their repeating message.

Sarah worked with teams around the clock, feeding the signal through every analysis tool available. The pattern was maddeningly elegant in its mathematical precision, yet resisted traditional cryptographic approaches.

"It's like they're speaking pure logic," she explained to the joint military-civilian committee on day three. The bags under her eyes testified to her lack of sleep, but her voice remained steady. "The structure suggests a language built on mathematical principles, but with complexities we're only beginning to grasp."
"Can you decode it or not?" demanded General Hayes, his uniform crisp despite the late hour.

"We're making progress, but-"

She was interrupted by an aide rushing into the conference room. "They're broadcasting something new," he announced, handing tablets to everyone present.
The new signal was different - simpler, more basic. It came with visual components: simple geometric shapes, mathematical sequences, basic physical constants. A primer.

Sarah felt a smile spread across her face as she recognized what they were seeing. "They're teaching us how to talk to them," she said. "Like a parent teaching a child the alphabet."

"Are we children to them, then?" someone asked.

Sarah studied the elegant simplicity of the alien communication. "Maybe," she admitted. "But at least they want to teach us."

The committee erupted into argument about security and a thousand other concerns. But Sarah was already lost in the patterns, her mind racing with possibilities. This was what she'd spent her career preparing for, though she'd never truly believed it would happen.

As dawn broke over Washington D.C., she stepped outside for a moment of fresh air. The alien ship hung in the sky like a new constellation, its presence both thrilling and terrifying. Sarah thought about all the languages she'd studied, how each one carried the weight of its culture's history and values. What would this new language reveal about its creators? What would humanity's first real words to another civilization be?

Her phone buzzed - another emergency meeting. As she turned to head back inside, Sarah caught a final glimpse of the ship above. Whatever happened next would change everything. She just hoped they were ready for it.
