subtitle: How does deductive truth (ie math) relate to inductive truth (ie science)?

A mathematical proof makes something true. But what is a 'proof'? In mathematics a proof means that we can agree upon a starting point and some rules, and with those rules we can find (aka 'prove') statements that are true!

For example, given a chess position, it is true that white can checkmate in 3 moves (if we follow the rules of chess). (Wf4->h6, Bg8->h6, Wd2->h6, Bf8->g8, Wf6->f7)

There are many other true statements that can be proven given this starting point (and following the rules of chess).

- The white king can move to d1.
- Black has 7 pawns.
- If (.. , .. , ..) then black wins.

Similar to how we use the rules of chess to derive things that are true about a given chess game. We can agree on objects called integers, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}, and agree on rules for adding and multiplying them, **+**, **x**. From these 'numbers' and their rules we can derive prime numbers, and even patterns within the primes (which some people consider to be beautiful truths).

[Euclidian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) is another example of a system of rules that can be used to derive true statements. 
Given the 5 postulates of Euclidian geometry, (basic equality rule, equality through operations, equality based on coincidence, universality of right angles, parallelism) we can derive the Pythagorean theorem, and many other true statements.

However, the real world is not like chess, integers or Euclidean geometry. It is complicated and hard to measure. Because of this, there is uncertainty in the observations we make. Maybe you have discovered life on the moon, or maybe there is a life-like smudge on your telesope.

This uncertainty is the problem science solves. Science attempts to systematically reduce our uncertainty about the truths determined by the physical rules of our universe. However, science only reduces uncertainty (rather than eliminates it), science cannot answer '_What makes something true?_', instead, science focuses on a different question.

> _What makes something likely to be true?_

Consider the question; _is the theory of general relativity likely to be true?_

Science can tell us;

1. it is more likely to be true than Newton's theory of gravity because it reliably makes more accurate predictions about celestial mechanics (the [Eddington experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_experiment)), as well as making predictions about other observations ( black holes, light, ... ) ( it's the current optimal hypothesis we have constructed, but there may exist others, that explain even more - ie dark matter )

2. it is more likely to be true because it has generalised. It has made accurate predictions about new observations (Einstein predicted gravitational waves in 1915). This tells us that, at least in this case, we didn't overfit to our existing observations. But, we have no clue how this theory will generalise to other unobserved phenomena.

3. it is more likely to be true because it explains our observations in a 'simple manner' ( ie Occam's razor ). General relativity can be derived from "the laws of physics areÂ invariant in all inertial frames of reference".

But these successes of general relativity are not sufficient to answer; 

> _is the theory of general relativity likely to be true?_ 

Our estimate of likelihood is based on our history (the data we happen to have collected), our imagination (the equations and models we have constructed, so far) and some assumptions.

#### Imperfect infomation

Our history could have been different. We could have made different observations or new ones. This is a problem of 'imperfect infomation'. We cannot observe everything of interest, rather we have an imperfect view. This yields uncertainty. But we can do little to reduce this uncertainty as there will always be unknown unknowns.

This means that science cannot actually answer "_What makes something likely to be true?_". Rather, the best science can do is;

> Given what we have observed, what is the most likely thing to be true?

<!-- (and how hard have we tried to find new data?) -->

#### Bounded resources

But, we cannot answer this question either. Our limited imagination means we may not have imagined the most likely answer. This is a problem of 'bounded resources'. The search for better theories ( that fit our current observations ) costs us resources such as energy, compute, time, ... So there is always a chance that our search finds a new, more likely to be true, theory. So, this allows us to answer;

> _Given what we have observed and the answers we have imagined, what is the most likely thing to be true?_

Note that as science progresses, as new new observations and new theories are imagined, our best guess at what is likely to be true may change.

Finally, we need to make some assumptions. These may seem pedantic. But, we are after the truth, which is a 100% guarantee! So, we need to assume that;

- the laws of the universe do not change with time. They are the same today as they are tomorrow, and the next day.
- the observations we made are not interfered with ( there doesn't exist an adversary manipulating our observations )

Note that, these assumptions cannot be proven to be true, and therefore we cannot claim that science gives us the truth. Rather we rely on arguments that prefer simplicity and hope for induction. So, we finally arrive at;

> If we assume the laws of the of the universe do not change, that simpler answers are more likely to be true_. We can answer; what is the most likely thing to be true? _Given what we have observed and the answers we have imagined__.

* * *

So, to be clear, science does not, and cannot answer the question "_what makes something true?_".
