### Introduction

While headlines scream about killer robots, a far more immediate threat lurks: the misalignment of corporations with the public good.

AI alignment, the field concerned with ensuring AI goals match human values, is crucial. But before worrying about hypothetical AI overlords, shouldn't we tackle the very real problem of corporations prioritizing profit over people and the planet?

### Aligning AI with human values.

AI alignment is about ensuring that AI systems not only achieve their goals but do so in a way that aligns with human values.
Imagine a robot programmed to clean your house. It might learn to maximize efficiency by throwing everything away â€“ not exactly helpful. This is the essence of misaligned AI, where the robot achieves its goal (cleanliness) but not in the way we intended.

There is much concern about the potential dangers of AI, with many researchers and organisations devoting significant resources to the problem.
For example; some of the big tech companies (OpenAI and DeepMind) have dedicated alignment teams, and there are other organisations that focus on AI safety and alignment, such as the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/), and the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/). 

<!-- For example, a superintelligent AI could decide that the best way to maximize the number of paperclips in the world is to turn the entire planet into a paperclip factory (known as the paperclip maximizer problem). -->

### Aligning corporations with the public good.

The modern corporation, as we know it, emerged during the Industrial Revolution. These early corporations were formed to pool resources and manage large-scale projects, such as building canals and railways. The intent was to limit individual liability and encourage investment, thereby stimulating economic growth and benefiting society as a whole.

Over time, corporate structures have evolved, with various models emerging to suit different business needs. The sole proprietorship, partnership, and limited liability company (LLC) are common examples. Each structure offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, balancing factors like control, liability, and taxation. However, the overarching goal remains the same: to facilitate economic activity and promote societal welfare.

 <!-- mechanism design. how can i include this?
Within economics, mechanism design is the study of how to design rules and incentives to get people to do what you want them to do.
We start from the end goal, and work backwards to design the rules and incentives that will get us there. -->
<!-- For example, we want people to drive safely. We design rules and incentives to get people to drive safely. We have speed limits, traffic lights, and fines for breaking the rules. -->

### The Misalignment Gap

But over time, many corporations have lost sight of their original purpose. Instead of serving the public good, they prioritize profit above all else.

<!-- examples; 2008 financial crisis, phillip morris, climate change, opiod crisis, arms... -->
For example;

- In the 2008 financial crisis, banks prioritized short-term profits over long-term stability, leading to a global economic meltdown.
- Tobacco companies like Philip Morris have knowingly misled the public about the dangers of smoking, putting profits ahead of public health.
- Oil companies have long denied the reality of climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence, to protect their bottom line.
- Pharmaceutical companies have fueled the opioid crisis by aggressively marketing addictive painkillers, leading to widespread addiction and death.

Instead of serving society, corporations exploit us for financial gain.

### Conclusion

While we imagine potential dangers of AI, mis-aligned corporations are causing harm right now. 
Let's devote more attention to aligning corporations with the public good.
