Hello! My first potential customer, welcome :). Here is the pitch:

Purchase health insurance from us for $5,000 per year. But, you can reduce that cost by giving us information.

## Use case

If you provide us your genome sequence we will reduce the cost by $1,000 per year (and pay for the sequencing - just let us know you want to do it and we will set up the appointment.)

## Privacy

(there are ways to maintain privacy while allowing analysis of the genome)

Now, I claim, we, the insurance providers, have a large incentive to accurately forecast your future health, and to gather information that is predictive of future complications and to act to minimise your health care costs.

Imagine (or maybe you don't have to...). Your genome reveals that you have the HER2 gene. We schedule and pay for regular screenings starting from when you turn 45. The logic being that the earlier we catch the cancer, the less damage it does and thus we have a smaller bill to insure!

There are some problems I can see with this idea:

- How can we make accurate predictions about risk and potential costs? Where would we get the data!? We would need to estimate; the average costs of health care, the value of knowing someone's genome, ...?
- If someone provides their genome, or other information, and we then know that they have a high risk of (say) pancreatic cancer then how can we nudge (manipulate) the you to get a check up?
- How can we make this system fair? I explicitly don't want to add costs dependent on the cost of health care as this breaks equity. In my mind insurance and welfare can achieve the same goals.
