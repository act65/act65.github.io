This blog series is my first serious foray into public political thought. My motivations are simple: a growing appreciation for how fortunate I was to grow up in Aotearoa New Zealand, coupled with a sobering understanding of how fragile political systems can be, and a recognition of humanity's often challenging and brutal history. These insights compel me to engage more deeply in shaping our nation's future.

This series explores Aotearoa's path forward through three fundamental questions:

[Part 1]({{site.baseurl}}/nz26-what-is/): What Is? – A Clear-Eyed Look at Our Current Reality

Before we can chart a course forward, we need an accurate map of where we currently stand. In this first part, we will delve into the data and evidence that describe the current state of Aotearoa New Zealand. From our infrastructure and economy to our social fabric and political systems, we'll explore what's working, what's not, and the systemic issues that often lie beneath the surface. This is about establishing a shared understanding of our starting point, grounded in verifiable information.

<!-- in principle we should be able to agree on this! -->

[Part 2]({{site.baseurl}}/nz26-what-should-be/): What Should Be? – Defining Our Aspirations and Ideals

Once we have a clearer picture of "What Is," we can then turn to the vital question of OUR aspirations. What kind of society do we want to build? What values and principles should guide us? This part is inherently subjective – it's where I will share my opinions, and you will likely disagree. There is no right answer here. Ultimately, the "What Should Be" is what we, as citizens, should debate and decide upon through our democratic choices.

<!-- so we need a system that gives everyone equal power in choosing 'what should be'. this is democracy! -->

[Part 3]({{site.baseurl}}/nz26-how/): How Do We Get There? – The Challenge of Implementation

With a grasp of our current reality and a vision for our desired future, the final, critical question is: How do we make it happen? This part will not offer a detailed policy prescription list from me. The complex work of designing and implementing effective solutions belongs to dedicated experts, working within transparent and accountable public institutions, and guided by a democratic mandate. Instead, we will explore the principles, the processes, and the mindset required to effectively navigate this path – focusing on the role of evidence, adaptive governance, addressing misaligned incentives, and fostering long-term thinking.

Join me as we explore these critical questions together.
