My thoughts related to this [short story](http://www.utilitarianism.com/greg-egan/Reasons-To-Be-Cheerful.pdf) by Greg Egan.

Awesome! It's a story about what would happen if you had full control over what makes you happy. This brings up a lot of interesting questions. Namely;

- What things, that I cannot control, make me happy?
- What things should I choose to make me happy? Are some thing better than others?
- What makes happiness so important, if I can just delude myself...

I feel like it summed up a lot of my struggles and life.

## My battles with 'synthetic happiness'

Synthetic happiness: (a term i came across in a TED talk a few years ago, and I think it is pretty apt) about the lies we tell ourselves to be happy. E.g.

- I have not had much luck with girls, so, to feel better about myself, I tell myself that girls don't matter, or that my ex was a bitch anyway.
- I do poorly on a test and I tell myself that the content was unimportant, or that I did well considering I didnt try.

I think people in general are too good at deluding themselves, through cognitive biases, wishful thinking and willful ignorance...

##  Taking control of my own life

- When I was studying engineering, I found myself entirely where I didnt want to be, having passively followed others. Which sparked my thoughts about what I want to make me happy.
- Over the last few years I have been trying to find a good (sustainable) source to derive my happiness from. (however, it is important to note that you cannot be happy all the time)
