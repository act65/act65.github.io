The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment in ethics. It goes like this:

> A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, saving the five people. However, there is one person on the side track. Do you pull the lever?

An alternative version goes like this;

> A young, healthy person walks into a hospital. Five patients are in need of organ transplants. Do you kill the young person and harvest their organs to save the five patients?

This thought experiment is used to explore the ethical dilemma of whether it is better to act in a way that saves the most lives (utilitarianism) or to act in a way that respects individual rights (deontology).

The correct answer appears to be to pull the lever (or transplant the organs), saving the five people at the expense of the one person, maximizing the number of lives saved.
However, there exist many arguments against this conclusion. Each as nonsensical as the last.

What is often ignored in this thought experiment is __(un)certainty__. In this case, we are certain that pulling the lever (or transplanting) will save the five people. However, in the real world, we are often uncertain about the consequences of our actions. This uncertainty is the problem with utilitarianism in practice.

We cannot predict the future. We cannot be sure that transplanting a heart will lead to a full recovery.

Consider the following scenario:

> A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are standing next to a lever that will probably divert (75%) the trolley onto a side track where one person is standing. But the train may derail and kill everyone (25%). Do you pull the lever?

Again, the correct answer appears to be to pull the lever, in expectation saving 3.75 people.
($0.75 \times 5 + 0.25 \times 0 = 3.75 $).
However, we have again assumed we can predict the future with certainty. Where did the 75% and 25% come from? How can we be sure that the trolley has a 75% chance of being diverted?
