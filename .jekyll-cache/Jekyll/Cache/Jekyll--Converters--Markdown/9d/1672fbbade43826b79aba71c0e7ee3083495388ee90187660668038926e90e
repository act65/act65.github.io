<p>Most integrals are expensive to evaluate. Integrals like ??? are an exception.
Monte carlo approximation, â€¦ are commmonly used tools for approximating</p>

<p>Variational inference.
Rather than maximising the hard to evaluate integral, maximise its lower bound. This ensures the â€¦</p>

<p>But how can we find these lower (or upper) bounds? We want to trade-off their accuracy for their computational cost.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to make a recursive version of integration by parts? $u(x), v(x): \int u dv = uv - \int vdu$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Integration problems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have distribution Q, want estimate of x under distribution P. Where there exists some relationship between $P$ and $Q$. e.g. $P = f(Q)$.</li>
