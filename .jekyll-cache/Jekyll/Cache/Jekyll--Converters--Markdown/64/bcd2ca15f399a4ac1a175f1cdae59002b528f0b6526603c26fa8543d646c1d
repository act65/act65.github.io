I"^<p>The <strong>Determinant</strong> is a measure of how a linear function scales a vector space (<em>does it get stretched or contracted?</em>). The <strong>Laplacian</strong> is a measure of how a gradient field expands/contracts space. These two notions have similar interpretations, yet their equations look different. What is the connection?</p>
