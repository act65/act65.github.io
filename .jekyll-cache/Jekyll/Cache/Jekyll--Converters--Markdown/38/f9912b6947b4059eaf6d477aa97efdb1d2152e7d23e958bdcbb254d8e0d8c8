<p>Equivalently, you could ask;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given a small code, our genome (on the order of mB), how is such complexity generated?</li>
  <li>Given a simple loss function how it can bootstrap itself to generate specialised experts? ‚Ä¶ through meta learning?</li>
  <li>Why does the humble natural selection algorithm generate the splendid diversity we see around us?</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a high level, this is the goal of scientific endeavour. To understand the complex phenomena we experience using simpler concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the goal of science? Generate accurate explanations for phenomena we observe. It isnt enough to just fit a model to the observed data, because we almost always do not have access to all of the information and thus we are solvig an underconstrained problem. There are many models that fit the data.</p>

<p>Imagine you want to understand {insert reduction lesson}. An interactive example would be nice!?</p>

<p>This method works well. But, what about when the simple bits are deeply entangled aka emergent behaviour, generative effects, ‚Ä¶?</p>

<p>So the question becomes; which model is the best one?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assumption 1: Reducability
If components of a model can independently explain some of the observed phenomena then the composition of those components makes a likely model.</li>
  <li>Assumption 2: Generality (it this different to simplicity? the assumption of an integrated representation of everything)</li>
  <li>Assumption 3: Simplicity (is this equivalent to reducability?)</li>
  <li>Assumption 4: Induction !?</li>
  <li>Assumptin 5: Smoothness/locality. A series of understandable, basic/atomic, steps taken.</li>
  <li>Assumption 6: Necessity implies causality (is that an assumption?!)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Show that: optimising a reward, in different environments (aka under different constraints/assumptions) various strategies (memory, safe trade, ‚Ä¶) emerge naturally.</p>

<p>Other ways of stating the same thing;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show which environments provide advantages to different strategies when optimising for the same goal.</li>
  <li>Show what is necessary/sufficient for a certain phenomena to emerge</li>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-to-understand">What does it mean to understand?</h3>

<p>Heirarchy of explanation;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Predictive (association. could just fit a fn)</li>
  <li>Generative (?)</li>
  <li>Disentanglement and reductionism. (this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn</code> is sufficient to generate Z from X and Z)</li>
  <li>Counterfactuals (via ablation) ‚Äì can give us necessity (given other assumptions). (X is necessary for Z)</li>
  <li>Advantages given by bounds on the complexities of resources. (why is X necessary for Z?)</li>
  <li>A single simple fn being optimised. (aka comression, or value, or ?!?)</li>
</ol>

<p>Process;</p>

<ul>
  <li>generate various emergent behaviours.</li>
  <li>study them and find patterns?</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶?</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions to answer;</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem being solved by X?</li>
  <li>And why is X necessary? (comprared to potential alternatives it ‚Ä¶?)</li>
  <li>What can inaccurate models tell us? The models half way along the trajectory?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Not only does a model have to be as simple as possible, but it also needs a simple process by which the model can arise. (is that the same as just having a model that is as simple as possible?)</p>

<p>Many models might fit the data. Only consider ‚Äúconstructible‚Äù (aka learnable?) models. (aka a bunch to steps from A to B)</p>

<p>Just give the process some names to make things clear.
\(Data \mathop{\rightarrow}_{Compress} Model \mathop{\rightarrow}_{Formalise} Axioms \\
Data \mathop{\leftarrow}_{Generate} Model \mathop{\leftarrow}_{Construct} Axioms \\\)</p>

<p>The axioms, given a ???, can construct the model.
The model, given an init, can generate the data.</p>

<p>Ahh, but when we are searching for the right axioms, we still use the data to constrain the space of models.</p>

<p>How can we formalise?
Imagine we have a model of particle physics. How can we find the minimal set of assumptions that (approximately) generate our model?</p>

<p>Nah, formalisation and compression are really the same thing? Take an explicit construction of something (a dataset or a model) and compress it.</p>

<p>The main question I would want to answer is; what advantage does X brain structure provide?

Can it generalise better? ‚Ä¶ etc Does the change help make more babies?</p>
