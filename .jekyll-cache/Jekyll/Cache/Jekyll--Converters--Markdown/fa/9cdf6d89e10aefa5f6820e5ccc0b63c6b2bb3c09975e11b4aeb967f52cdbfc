I"K<p>My name is Alex. I want to be smart(er). This place for me to put the things I would like others to see. My notes and ideas about computer science and its applications;</p>

<p><strong><em>Brains, learning, languages, control, scientific method, natural sciences, computation, math, compression, automation, energy, …</em></strong></p>

<p>For the things I don’t want people to see, check out my other <a href="https://act65com.wordpress.com/">blog</a>. Which is less technical, less polished, more opinionated, and more personal.</p>

<p>I simply forked this blog from <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now</a> and renamed it (it took me a couple of hours…). Feel free to fork the original or <a href="https://github.com/act65/act65.github.io">mine</a>.</p>

<p>Also. Here is my <a href="\CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
