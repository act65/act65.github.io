<p>Want to infer the optimal actions.
This requires us to infer the payoffs.
Which actions (aka measurements) should we choose to efficiently discover the payoffs?</p>

<p>http://proceedings.mlr.press/v22/carpentier12/carpentier12.pdf</p>

<p>For linear MDPs (of the Jin type), is there also a connection to CS?
But, need the Q values to be sparse??</p>

<p>What is the structure of the smallest set of measurements / actions</p>

<p>But, CS is not adaptive. While we care about making exploration algols that
pick actions / measurements given past knowledge.
So this has applications to NMR measurements?</p>
