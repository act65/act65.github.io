I"Ê<p>I am excited by the application of learning theory to the natural sciences, for example; the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608142">learnability of quantum states</a>, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07659">learnability beyond the diffraction limit</a> or <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2643031/Valiant_Evolvability.pdf">evolvability via learning theory</a>. I would like to see this approach taken further!</p>
