I"y<p>The <strong>Determinant</strong> is a measure of how a linear function scales a vector space (<em>does it get stretched or contracted?</em>). The <strong>Laplacian</strong> is a measure of how a gradient field expands/contracts space. These two notions have similar interpretations, yet their equations look different. What is the connection?</p>

<h2 id="the-determinant">The Determinant</h2>

<p>The most intuitive definition of the determinant (in my opinion) is;</p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{Let } y &amp;= Ax \\
\det(A) &amp;= \prod_{i=0}^n \sigma_i \\
\end{align}\]

<side>SVD decoposition: any matrix $A$ can be decomposed as $A = USV^T$, where $U, V$ are unitary and $S$ is a diagonal matrix.</side>
<p>assuming you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition">SVD</a>, you will know that the singular values of the SVD decomposition $\sigma_i$ are the scaling factors applied by the transformation $A$. Thus their product tells us how a unit square would change volume as it is scaled.</p>

<h2 id="laplacian">Laplacian</h2>

<p>The laplacian of a (continuious fn?) is defined as the divergence of the gradient.</p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{div}(\nabla f) &amp;= \nabla \cdot \nabla f \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{\partial^2 f_i}{\partial x_i^2} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>But why have we ignored the cross terms $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_k}$? I would have expected these to be present in a measure of how volume expands.</p>

<p>What does it do? Need some intuition!! TODO</p>

<h2 id="exterior-algebra">Exterior algebra</h2>

<p>Ok. After a while stumbling around wikipedia, a few bright ideas that were quickly extnguished, and many combinations of keywords I saw the connection! It’s the exterior algebra (I was actually given a hint by one of my professors that this was the case, but it still took me a while to find the connection…).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exterior algebra Λ(V) of a vector space V over a field K is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra T(V) by the two-sided ideal I generated by all elements of the form x ⊗ x for x ∈ V.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good. I am sure that cleared everything up…</p>

\[\begin{align}
e_2 \wedge e_1 &amp;= −(e_1 \wedge e_2) \\
e_i \wedge e_i &amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

<p>(why are these true?)</p>

<p>Awesome. We copied down the math. But what does it really mean?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h2 id="a-2-blade-space-only-has-1-dimension-e_1-wedge-e_2-a-3-blade-space-has-3-dimensions-e_1-wedge-e_2-e_2-wedge-e_3-e_1-wedge-e_3-a-4-blade-has-6-12-13-14-23-24-34">A 2-blade space only has 1 dimension $(e_1 \wedge e_2)$. A 3-blade space has 3 dimensions $(e_1 \wedge e_2), (e_2 \wedge e_3), (e_1 \wedge e_3)$. A 4-blade has 6 $(12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34)$.</h2>

</ul>

<h4 id="the-determinants-relationship-with-the-exterior-product">The determinant’s relationship with the <u>exterior product</u></h4>

<p>What is the exterior product? (TODO want to explain/give intuition)</p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbf u &amp;= u_1e_1 + u_2e_2 \\
\mathbf v &amp;= v_1e_1 + v_2e_2 \\
\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v &amp;= u_1v_1 (e_1\wedge e_1) + u_2v_1 (e_2\wedge e_1) + u_1v_2 (e_1\wedge e_2) + u_2v_2 (e_2\wedge e_2) \\
&amp;= 0 + (-)u_2v_1(e_1\wedge e_2) + u_1v_2 (e_1\wedge e_2) + 0 \\
&amp;= (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)(e_1 \wedge e_2) \\
\end{align}\]

<p>Should be easy to see the relation to the determinant.</p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= [\mathbf u, \mathbf v] \tag{stack the vectors}\\
\det (A) &amp;= u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \\
\end{align}\]

<p>But they are not quite the same (?). For a measure of area we require;</p>

\[\begin{align}
A(i\mathbf u, j\mathbf v) &amp;= ijA(\mathbf u, \mathbf v) \\
A(\mathbf u, \mathbf u) &amp;= 0 \\
A(\mathbf u, \mathbf v) &amp;= -A(\mathbf v, \mathbf u) \\
A(\mathbf u + j\mathbf v, \mathbf v) &amp;= A(\mathbf u, \mathbf v) \\
A(\mathbf e_1, \mathbf e_2) &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

<p>(oh. kk. it is like a generalisation of the determinant to higher dims?!)</p>

<h3 id="divergence">Divergence</h3>

<p>Ok, next.</p>

<p>(quick review)</p>

<p>To be more careful. The divergence measures the ‘flux’ of</p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{div}F &amp;= \lim_{V \to p} \int_{S(V)} \frac{F \cdot n(S)}{\mid V\mid } dS \\
&amp;= \nabla \cdot F \tag{!?!}\\
\end{align}\]

<ul>
  <li>is it possible to have negative flux in some dims and positive in others?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="divergences-relation-with-the-exterior-derivative">Divergence’s relation with the <u>exterior derivative</u></h4>

<p>What is the exterior derivative? (TODO want to explain/give intuition)</p>

<p>One can express the divergence as a particular case of the exterior derivative, which takes a 2-form to a 3-form in R3. Define the current two-form as</p>

\[\begin{align}
j &amp;= F_1 dy \wedge dz + F_2 dx \wedge dz + F_3 dx \wedge dy \\
\end{align}\]

<p>It measures the amount of “stuff” flowing through a surface per unit time in a “stuff fluid” of density $ρ = 1 dx \wedge dy \wedge dz$ moving with local velocity $F$. Its exterior derivative $dj$ is then given by</p>

\[\begin{align}
dj &amp;= \Big( \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z} \Big) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
\end{align}\]

<h2 id="jacobis-formula">Jacobi’s formula</h2>

<p>\(\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \det A(t) &amp;= tr\Big(adj(A(t)) \frac{dA(t)}{dt}\Big)\\
adj(A) &amp;= \det (A) \cdot A^{-1} \\
\frac{d}{dt} \det A(t) &amp;= tr\Big(\det (A) \cdot A^{-1}(t) \cdot \frac{dA(t)}{dt}\Big) \\
\end{align}\)
potentially useful?
\(tr(A) = log(det(exp(A))) \\\)
Nah. that’s just using exp to turn multiplication into summation.</p>
