What about other types of graph. Hyper, ...!?

<p>We say things like ‚Äúthe sun is hot because of the energy released by the fusion of hydrogen atoms‚Äù. We could construct a graph of concepts and relations, linking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the sun</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hot</code> via some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is</code> relation, and ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>But <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the sun</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hydrogen atoms</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">energy</code>, ‚Ä¶ are not basis concepts (and neither are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">because</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">released</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fusion</code>, ‚Ä¶ basis relations), they are extremely complicated ideas built up by experience and reasoning.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the sun</code> could be represented as a graph of ‚Äòmore basic‚Äô concepts, ‚Äúthe bright thing that moves across the sky‚Äù. And again, these concepts and relations could be decomposed.</p>

<hr />

<p>We will need a graph equiped with an enbedding fn and a function for composition.</p>

<p>\(\begin{align}
V &amp;\subseteq \mathbb X^m \\
E &amp;\subseteq \mathbb X^n \\
G &amp;:= \mathcal P(V)\times \mathcal P(E) \\
\\
f: G &amp;\rightarrow V \tag{embed graph in node}\\
\circ: G \times G &amp;\rightarrow G \tag{compose two graphs} \\
\end{align}\)
the ability to take $\mathcal G \rightarrow v$</p>

<p>What about $e,v \in \mathbb C^d$. Where edges and nodes share the same space!? But are composed via $e^T \cdot v$!?

<h2 id="isomorphism-and-a-metric">Isomorphism and a metric</h2>

<p>We can define a metric on the space $G$.</p>

\[d: G \times G \rightarrow \mathbb R^+ \\
d(g_i, g_j) = \parallel f(g_i) - f(g_i)\parallel \\
symmetry, reflexivity, transitivity...\]

<p>Thus graph isomorphism can be computed approximately Convolutional
\(\begin{align}
bool &amp;= g_i \equiv g_j \tag{graph isomorphism}\\
&amp;\approx d(g_i, g_j) \le \epsilon \tag{approximation} \\
\end{align}\)</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<p>Any $G$ must be constructed using only the basis nodes $v \in V: ?$. What about the edges!?</p>

<p>And feasible graphs must be constructible via bases. (this is the part we seem to have missed)</p>

<h2 id="graph-embedding">Graph embedding</h2>

<p>So how ‚Äòshould‚Äô it be done? Message passing through the edges?
Maybe this needs to be softened?
To a graph compression!?</p>

<h2 id="graph-composition">Graph composition</h2>

<p>Does this need to be a learned function?</p>

<p>If a node already exists (but nodes are in $\mathbb X^m$ so we need a metric‚Ä¶ if X is the reals then!??).</p>

<ul>
  <li>What if we have the same node in a graph twice?! Is that allowable?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="indexing-a-dictionary-of-graphs">Indexing a dictionary of graphs</h2>

<p>Given these ops you could imagine a dictionary of graphs.</p>

\[\{v_i: g_i \mid\;\text{where}\; v_i = f(g_i) \} \\\]

<p>This dictionary can be indexed by a graph.</p>
