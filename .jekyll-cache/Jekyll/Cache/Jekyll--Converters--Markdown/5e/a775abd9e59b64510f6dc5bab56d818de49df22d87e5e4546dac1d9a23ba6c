What is with the weird notation that physicists use?!</p>

\[\phi: X\times Y \to \mathbb R \\
d\phi = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy\]

<ul>
  <li>Wait, what are we differentiating with respect to?</li>
  <li>How come we have $\phi$ on the LSH, but $f$ on the RHS?!</li>
  <li>What is $d()$???</li>
</ul>

<p>$d\phi: X \times Y \to \mathbb R$
Equals the jacobian. (when working in a vector space!?)</p>

<p>Best linear approximation at $x$.</p>
