I"ß<p>Typical smart city solutions seem to focus on gathering <strong>evidence for/of problems</strong>, i.e. measuring built and social environments. This is useful as it can motivate action and change. However, this problematic data does not help us solve the problems once identified. For this we need <strong>evidence for/of solutions</strong>. How have past policies changed cities? Which policies seem to work? Which policy would be most effective/efficient in this case?</p>
