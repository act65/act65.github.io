I"s<p>I am excited by the application of learning theory to the natural sciences, for example; the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0608142">learnability of quantum states</a>, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07659">learnability beyond the diffraction limit</a> or <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2643031/Valiant_Evolvability.pdf">evolvability via learning theory</a>. I would like to see this approach taken further!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the limits of our ability to learn about the universe?</p>

<p>Maybe some facts about the universe are unlearnable because there is only so much data we can collect, or there is too much noise in our measurements, or it would take too many computational resources. I want to know the limits of what science can tell use about the universe!</p>

<p>Open questions;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the interaction between a measurement and quantum state mean that we cannot distinguish all quantum states?</li>
  <li>Will there ever be enough accurate data to specify a unique model of the origin of the universe?</li>
  <li>? (more to come)</li>
</ul>
