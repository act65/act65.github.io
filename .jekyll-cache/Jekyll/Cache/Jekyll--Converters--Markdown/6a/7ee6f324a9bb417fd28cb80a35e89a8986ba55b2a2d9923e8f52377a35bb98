I"<p>Many approaches to physics come from ‘first principles’.
Rather, I want to go back to the data and ask; what does it really tell us?</p>

<p>I think existing theories used to explain quantum physics are crap. They make these outraegous interpretations and justify them by saying “there doesn’t exist a better model / interpretation, so just deal with it”. See my post louding expressing my thoughts about; states that depend on whether you are observing them,  entanglement, …</p>

<p>So, I figure, go back to the fundamentals: what does the data say? Maybe there is a better explanation.</p>

<p>Compton scattering</p>

<p>https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.21.483</p>

<p>tldr: Photons bounce off electrons. But the photons deflection appears to depend only on wavelength, not intensity of the light.</p>

<p>How does that data actually say this?!</p>

<p>The Stern–Gerlach experiment</p>

<p>The double slit experiment</p>

<p>tldr: A laser is pointed at two slits. Behind the slits an ‘interference pattern’ is formed.</p>

<p>The photoelectric effect</p>

<p>Blackbody radiation</p>

<p>Others!?</p>

<p>Ideally we would just build a test set of these experiments and allow computers to search through possible models?!?</p>
