Inspired-by / a-review-of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDePmv6h3II&index=198&list=WL) talk by Julia Galef. (great talk)

> Cognitive biases, the study of how other people think.

The talk focuses on anomalies and how noticing them can help us be more rational. So;

- what are the little things that I ignore?
- how can I motivate myself to look for them?
- how can I make it a habit?

> The problem: we see what we expect to see (based on our beliefs), and our beliefs are based on what we see. ...

And due to this we end up missing a lot of little hints that our models are not accurate. Personally, I think this is what can take you from being normal to smart. Noticing the inconsistencies and chasing them up. E.g. any good scientific work.

How to get feedback and how to notice things that are surprising? Make predictions! Keep a journal of small predictions, with your certainty. Then can measure things I am over/under confident about.

> A bet is a tax on bullshit

Try to look for anomalies. If you are trying to look for anomalies, then everything starts to look like an anomaly.

> Fighting confirmation bias with confirmation bias

### Motivation

What is the best motivation for being rational? Is it simply wanting to be rational? How about to impress girls/boys? To appear smart? ... No. Dont try to be rational, but learn to care about having good models, about knowing the truth, ... understanding.
