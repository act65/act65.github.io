What would happen if we could explain the universe in a theory of everything? (Inspired by [The beginning of infinity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity?from_search=true&search_version=service) by David Deutsch.)

## Good explanations

What makes a good explanation?

Being able to;

- make accurate predictions (specific).
- make (accurate) predictions about many diverse/different phenomena (general).
- use small amounts of input information.
- compose the input information in simple and minimal ways (elegance).

_What is the difference between a an explanation and a prediction?_

## What if I could explain everything?

What if I could explain everything? And do it with only a single short explanation. Kinda like a theory of everything? What happens at the max/min? Where we have all information, represented in a minimally sized integrated structure.

Is this similar to what evolution is trying to do (minimising conceptual complexity through energy efficiency, and maximising integrated information through memory and experience)? Is this similar to what physicists are trying to do (one equation to describe everything)?

### A fundamental limit?

It struck me that our search for a theory of everything is somewhat similar to asking, does our universe have a shorter description? So currently, the evolution of the universe in time is perfectly predicted by the universesâ€™ current state (although some/many/all quantum physicists may argue?). If we found a theory of everything that could predict the universes evolution in time with perfect accuracy then we have compressed all the information within the universe into something within the universe.

Given this shorter description, have we then created a universe within a universe? Is our universe reducible? Could it be represented with less?

These questions remind me of the structure, and limits, of a turing machine. Can you get a turing machine to simulate itself? And when applied to our setting, is our universe a computation; to see whether it can be represented in a shorter description? Does this make the end/future of our universe undecidable, like the halting problem? It seems like the notion of a perfectly predictive theory of everything is a contradiction/paradox.

One last question: Is the description of something the same as the thing itself?
