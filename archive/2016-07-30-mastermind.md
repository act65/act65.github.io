So, imagine that you have an IQ of 1327, a perfect memory, unwavering attention and unbreakable will. What would you do with yourself?

- Solve a difficult math puzzle?
- Become a president?
- Write a book?
- Solve the SDGs?
- World domination?
- Research AI/IA and become even smarter?
- Cure cancer?

Hmm. They just seem like they would be too easy.

To be honest I find it hard to think about what I would want to do. It seem like half the enjoyment of doing things is that they are hard, they require effort, they are uncertain, ... And without these hardships doing anything seem far more lacklustre...?!
