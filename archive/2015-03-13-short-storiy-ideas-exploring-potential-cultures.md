I just wanted to document some of the ideas I have on the subject of short fictional stories on culture(s). Feel free to comment on these ideas, suggest improvements or other ideas and/or use these ideas for your own stories. At some point in the future... I plan/hope to turn my favorites into stories.

- There are no parents, well there are in the genetic sense. All children are taken away from their parents at birth and raised by professional educators and child carers. This is done in the name of efficiency and the division of labor.
- Everyone is assigned a to be within a group of 20 people, where groups are randomly assigned. You cannot change groups. These groups must meet up and do certain activities annually. The point of these groups is to encourage understanding and empathy for vastly different people who are in different circumstances and positions.
- Everyone has a partner. At a certain age everyone chooses. To be single is to be unwanted, to be an outcast. To be single is equivalent of being homeless in our society.
- People work out and preen. Everyone struts around like peacocks do... I'm sexy and I know it... (David Attenborough - esque documentary. "The funny thing is that all of these creature are soo deluded that they all think they are the sexiest person alive...")
- A paradox between individuality and fashion. People spend all their time designing their outfit to express their individuality. Those who don't are branded as boring and conformers. But really, the boring conformers are the only ones with substantial personalities?
- People older than 50 are killed. Chronically sick people are killed. Disabled and retarded people are killed. This is done because their ROI is on average negative, health care, ... (attacking the notion that people are expendable as viewed by business men cutting costs)
- Satiric. Having a go at fences and private property. Everyone has 20m fences around their property, lined with security cameras and remote controlled guns. (the point being the higher your fence/guard the lonelier you are?)
- Guilty until proven innocent, proven until proved ridiculous. Reductio ad absurdum for the argument, you must prove that god doesn't exist.Â Everything is believed, any assertion. Of guilt, of a higher power, of truth ... How would/who would be responsible for disproving these assertions?
