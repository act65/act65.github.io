title: Equilibrium propagation

So as we scale to larger networks, we need;

- more time / iterations for an equilibrium to be reached?!
- how do you efficiently fit the topology into 3d...!?
- ???

Not clear to me how setting I

$$
I_k^+ = \beta (Y_k)
$$

Still curious about connections between langevin dynamics and distributions.
Want the ability to transform between implicit and explicit distributions easily?!
To integrate the noise in langevin dynamics or to sample from a distribution!?
