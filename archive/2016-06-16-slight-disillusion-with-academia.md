This was initially going to be an email, but I thought I would post it here instead as I ended up talking myself out of it/rationalising. But its always nice to see others struggling ... (in the sense that you can share vulnerabilities).

_Hey,_

_I have been having some trouble lately with uni and wondered if you could give me some advice._

_I tend to find myself working towards/caring about things I don't actually want. What I mean is that: I like learning, exploring and creating - aka research - and there is nothing else I really want to do with myself. I especially like big/deep questions and anything related to 'how to think'._

_But instead I find myself; caring about the grades I get on my next test, trying to impress my peers and my lecturers, wanting to publish papers... (and then procrastinating from doing these...)_

_Not to mention that I also have a few issues with some systems/cultures in academia;_

- _publish or perish - resulting in the average paper being some half-baked idea/not really contributing anything,_
- _grad students as workhorses/the PhD factory_
- _having to 'sell' yourself or justify research to others - peers/colleagues, investors/grant givers_
- _researchers obsession with ownership of 'their' ideas,_
- _and more generally some dangerous views on productivity, ambition, success and status._

_Although I don't know how accurate these are. I fear these are just some realities of life?_

_I sometimes find myself thinking that I could do better, more focused, research on deep/big problems outside of academia, in my own time. So, I guess I am saying that I find my research less fun because of the pressures, distractions and flaws of academia._

_What are your thoughts?_

_Alex_

I think I am just looking for (/need) some more security and confidence. But, I have some tests coming up so i'll get back to these thoughts later.
