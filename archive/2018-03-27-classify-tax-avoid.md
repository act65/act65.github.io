## Classifying tax avoidance

Tax avoidance is defined as (in my own words); when a law is used in a way that was not intended.

when the finances of an individual / company are organised in a way

<!-- set of actions that are legal, but when viewed from a 'global' perspective, their only purpose is to avoid tax. -->

The more formal version is:

### Credit assignment

So if we have a set of loss function that capture the tax payers goals, ... and tax minimisation.

Can we assign credit to certain actions? WANT: this (set of) action(s) minimised tax paid, and did little else. (in fact, it made the company have a more complex structure and harder to run everyday.)

Overfitting to approximate models, can do well in the virtual world, but poorly in the real world.




Legal questions

* What if I am overpaying my tax and then reorganise my finances so that I now pay as much as I 'should' be.
* The law seems to be two things? Specifies (some of) the allowable moves, a classifier of avoidance.
