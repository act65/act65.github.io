A process for exploring and evaluating ideas. Where the goal is to shoot them down quickly.

Inspired by Astro Teller’s [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtCBCa7DiHo) and a comment by Roger Grosse.

## Why?

Opportunity cost!!! I have known about this idea for a few years now, but I have failed to really internalise it properly. I have always struggled with choosing, and I hate the idea of letting circumstances/my environment make my decisions. So this is an attempt to take some control of my research direction(s).

In a couple of years I hope to be doing a PhD so this will act as a kind of survey of cool ideas that I would want to study during my PhD.

To find a balance between focus and curiosity. (I really struggle with this )

## How?

- Make a list of ideas
- Spend an hour on each idea, aim for around 50.
    - Write a clear(er) definition. Browse - google scholar etc
- Cut down to 20 - spend 5 hours on each.
    - Estimate result if successful, amount of time required …
- Cut down to 5 - spend 25 hours on each.
    - Write a jupyter notebook/blog post - formatting time doesn’t count
- If a good project presents itself, do it.
- Else, repeat.

(Be strict on time limits? )

I’ll attempt to go through this process over the next couple (2) of months.
