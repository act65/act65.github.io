I get annoyed with my psychological defense mechanisms. They make me feel good, safe, special, ... they help me forget.

But I want to remember that;

- I am loosing brain cells every day,
- Thousands of people die every day and I could have helped them,
- Every day I am closer to death,
- If I had tried harder, embraced the uncertainty and responsibility I could have changed the world.

These things should scare the shit out of you, figuratively, literally. We should be having horrific nightmares every night; alzheimer's slow progress taking everything we value, a foreign nation invading us while the world watches apathetically, our children killed by the climate due to our own selfish actions, ...

Yet we are not. Most of us sleep without a worry in the world, or if we are worried, it is about our boss, or our affair, or favorite sports team, ... We are selfish and short sighted.

I want to be more miserable, I should be more miserable. I want to bear these burdens. To be: brave in the face of fear, determined to endure the pang of sadness, confident despite the soullessness of depression, ... in the hope they will motivate action. Contentment, comfort and safety never motivated anyone to change the world.

But, I understand, we are human. And it is just easier to forget the pain. It hurts. _How can we be better? How can we remember and make these matters more urgent in our minds?_

People are wasting their lives, lost amongst distraction and frivolous entertainment... Distracted from deep questions like; can the standard model accommodate dark matter and massive neutrinos? Can we eradicate poverty in the next 5 years? Can we adapt to the effects of climate change and will our children survive? How does learning theory unify evolution, cognition, computation and physics? Can we live past 2000 years?

So, until the last person dies of hunger, until we verify the standard model, until I am no longer dying, until people treat others with compassion, until gravity is unified with quantum physics, util ALS is treatable, until the world is right. I am banning happiness, censoring joy, prohibiting entertainment, and placing a moratorium on fun.
