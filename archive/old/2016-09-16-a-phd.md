To me a PhD is (or at least should be) 3 years of freely exploring the details of some idea that the vast majority of people either; don't think will work, think it's a waste of time, don't think anything as they have never even thought/heard of it.

A PhD program should;

- protect you from pressures to publish and 'succeed'. And from the nay-sayers that nay-say.
- give you some financial and intellectual support.
- ?

Reasons to pick a PhD program/uni/advisor;

- they research what you are interested in. Not just kind of close. Having a good computer science department doesn't count as being close to wanting to research ML
- you know (to some extent) that the supervisor is 'good'. Allocates lots of time to students, tries to mentor their students, is known for their thought process...
- they have a good/vibrant research group. A mixing post of ideas and lots of collaboration.

Reasons not to pick a PhD program/uni/advisor;

- it's a prestigious PhD program/uni/advisor (e.g. somewhere like Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley... ).
- the university is in a cool city (Vienna, NY, ...).
- the current topic is 'hot'.
- post graduation you will earn lots of money.

Why do I even want to do a PhD?

- Having a PhD is a reason to be confident. I will have proven myself worthy.
- It is the sort of thing that (I think) people like me do.
- It gives me a chance to do the things I like. Learning, creating, discovering...
- What else would I do? Hmm...
