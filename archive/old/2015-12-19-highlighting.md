So, I use Mendely when I am reading papers and Diigo on websites. If an interesting point is made, or a good question is asked I will generally highlight it.

But, am I using this as an excuse not to remember things? I find myself remembering little of what I do highlight, only that it was something important.

Maybe I need to make a habit of writing more notes and highlighting less. Or while highlighting a passage, reread the passage.
