I was reading [this](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/) great blog post, by Michael Nielsen, about how to do effective research and came across the idea of the _problem-creator_.

> Problem-creators may often write papers that are technically rather simple, but ask an interesting new question, or pose an old problem in a new way, or demonstrate a simple but fruitful connection that no-one previously realized existed.

I think this is what I would love to do / be. I see this type of work as the most valuable and requiring the greatest intellect / creativity / wisdom. As after a problem is well defined, you can always find some plebs to crack it for you.

So what is this sort of work? According to the blog post you would ask questions such as;

> What do you think are the characteristics of important science? What makes one area thrive, while another dies away? What sorts of unifying ideas are the most useful? What have been the most important developments in your field? Why are they important? What were the apparently promising ideas that didn’t pan out? Why didn’t they pan out?

A few others I can think of;

- What are the small niggly things and the strange inconsistencies that crop up throughout the field. Is there something we are missing?
- What common belief is harmful to the field? (borrowing from [one](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22477307-this-idea-must-die?from_search=true&search_version=service) of John Brockman's questions)
- What are the good ideas that are not taken seriously or not popular, but should be?
- Are we even asking the right questions?

(I am sure there are many more, let me know if you think of any)

In my interpretation of problem-creators, I think they (should);

- take a far wider (and deeper - but don't ask me how) view of their field of investigation,
- seriously question their goal and proposed methods to get there,
- make connections, direct inquiry and (try to) avoid dogma,
- help others to do the same.

So, if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be _Meta_.

So far, my current inspiration for this type of thought process are;

- Paul Erdos' [biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/714583.The_Man_Who_Loved_Only_Numbers) titled _The man who only loved numbers_
- Lake et al. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289) on _Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People_
- Richard Hamming's [essay](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) titled _You and your research_
- and obviously this blog [post](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/) by Michael Nielsen.

(Let me know if you know of other work/people that inspires you to pose problems rather than focusing on solving them.)
