The first time I went to university was your typical student, lost and confused. I didn't know I wanted from my education, from others, or even myself. I drifted through university getting average grades and spent far too much time just going with the flow. My friends thought mechanical engineering was cool, so I thought it was cool. My friends would be going out, so I would go out. My friends though I should like a girl, so I liked the girl. And the story goes on...

This time is  different.
