There is a quote that states that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence", where, in our culture, this burden of evidence is always put on the claimant. But I would urge you to reconsider this practice.

A friend claims (in typical conspiracy theorist style) that there is a medical wonder cure that cures cancer, however, it has been hushed up by large pharmaceutical corporations. Now this seems to be a relatively common claim on the Internet, to which I do not know the truth. In typical skeptic/scientific style I assume that the claim is false as I have not been presented enough evidence to convince me and/or it breaks fundamental physical laws that I have learnt and/or it deliberately avoids describing how it works and/or ... So, what if my friend mis-represented the science of the cure and/or forgot to point out that large pharmaceutical corporations have motive and means, and have done so in the past, and/or ...

I am definitely not a fan of believing everything that you hear. However, I think it can also be bad to disbelieve things too easily, at least to the extent that you do not do further research. Because of the extraordinary benefit that the cure could have I think that you, or I, have the responsibility to investigate further. Simply, we are just balancing the likelihood versus the benefit. And in this case although the likeliness of this claim being true is < 0.001% (as gauged by me), the potential benefit is massive.

Does this mean that I should be spending all my time investigating any/all claims that have some sort of benefit? No. But where to draw the line is not very clear, I will leave that up to you. I just wanted to point out we seem to have a kind of bias against these sorts of things, but maybe we should be more careful as we could unknowingly dismiss something important.
