The goal of this article is to investigate types of confusion and how, why and when they manifest.

**A definition.** Confusion teds to be highly linked with disorder and understanding. A lack of clarity or order. To thoroughly mix; to confound; to disorder. To mistake one thing for another. Unable to think clearly or understand. Making no sense, illogical. Synonyms**:** Disorganised, distracted, muddled, perplexed, puzzled, flustered, chaotic, jumbled...

# Confusion resulting from;

##### Abstruse abstractions.

Thought must be grounded in specific, often concrete, examples. (The only reason math can get away with high level abstractions is that the semantics and syntax of math requires total specificity) When you take a shot at a goal or make a conjecture, which you didn't clearly define, you can always move the target. In general, the more abstract an idea the more ambiguous is it, and the more ambiguous an idea/statement, the less it means. For example;

>  Good things come to those who wait There’s no I in Team It is what it is Winners never quit

Details are important, and ignoring them will mean that your version of the details will be coloured by assumptions and heuristics, rather than facts. It shouldn't be hard to see that this can easily lead to confusion.

##### Disorganised dementia.

Imagine trying to solve a sudoku puzzle, but each of the squares in the 9x9 array is located in a different room, in a different book. It will be very hard to imagine how all the different parts interact. However, if we are more organised and place all the 9x9 squares together, and in order, then it will be far simpler to see how they relate and to solve the puzzle. The real goal is to be able to see how all the part of your problem interact.

Others? Intuition, focus, ?
