The latest and greatest motivational technique!!! (personally I never thought I would write any self-help, but here I go...)

Explanation through examples. I have used the same trick twice to help motivate myself through tough experiences. To do an ironman and to (finally) quit pointless videos and facebook/twitter/... browsing.

What I told myself when training for the ironman was that: "_I wanted to do the ironman to prove to myself that I could be self-motivated and strong._" However, this required me to be self-motivated and strong (which I wasn't particularly).

And what I told myself to finally manage to quit distraction (youtube, fb, ...) was that: "_I wanted to prove to myself that I could change, that I was still in charge._" However, this required me to change, to allow me to change (people don't really change). And to be in charge (when I am not...).

The interesting thing is that, both times it worked, and on the first try. I have finished an ironman and I am distraction free.

However, there certainly were other factors involved. I doubt I would have completed the ironman without my flatmate (who was also doing it). And given the amount of times I have tried to quit youtube/fucking about one of them was bound to work. It may just be that this is exactly the sort of thing you tell yourself when you really want something, and thus it is just a result of already having a large amount of motivation.

But maybe it works! An it is the wonder cure to fix all motivational issues. I'll write a book and make millions...
