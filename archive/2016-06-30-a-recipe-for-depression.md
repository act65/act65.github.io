I wanted to talk about (my) depression. In some senses I think I am cheating, as you are supposed to talk to others while depressed (to help you get through it) but I am doing it now that I have (some what) dealt with/forgotten my issues.

For four months last year (2015), I found it hard to be happy. That might not sound so bad, but not being able to be happy is by far the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. It isn't that I was sad, or angry, or full of guilt or envy or laziness, I just didn't care (the opposite of happiness isn't sadness). Politics that used to make me indignant made me glaze over, science that sparked my wonder seemed useless... I withdrew from friends... I felt worthless and I disgusted myself, ... These words seem hollow, and I struggle to get this feeling across. Suffice to say, it was hard.

For those who want to give it a go themselves, here is my recipe for depression.

### Recipe

- Read some Noam Chomsky on politics,
- read Peter Singer's _The life you can save_,
- go to some third world country and experience it,
- return to your perfect life.

That is what I did, but more important is what I believed.

- That lots of people doing something (in this case, not helping others) does not make it ok.
- That I was a good person.
- That I should adhere to some higher level of responsibility.
    - That you either care or not, there is no middle ground.
    - Inaction is an action. (opportunity cost)
    - Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse.

I would actually encourage others to go through this experience, except in a more controlled and supportive environment. I learnt a lot about myself and about the state of the world.

I think my main reasons for being depressed were; feeling powerless in the face of massive systemic issues, facing the realisation that I wasn't a good person, feeling worthless and that my life is devoid of any purpose, and turning my back on people I loved.

### Children are lovable

It is hard to describe how much children can grow on you in [a few short months](https://act65com.wordpress.com/2015/10/09/the-house-of-hope/), and it seems unnatural. But I really came to love those children. Each with their hopes, dreams and quirks. I had my favorites, especially amongst the girls (as many of the girls were so timid and submissive it was the ones who were not that really stood out).

- Both Sangetha and Theeksanya spoke good english and were only 9-10, I mean they spoke better than the vast majority of their elders, and even some staff. They weren't afraid to get up in class and help others out, if fact I enlisted their help while teaching classes.
- Roja was naughty. She regularly disobeyed the staff, and wasnt afraid of them (although she had every right to be). I loved her spirited nature.
- Vallarassu was just a real genuine boy, who was ever curious about my world. Being one of the oldest children (15) he could speak some english. He seemed to care deeply about his family (two younger siblings also at the orphanage).
- Elarvarsi, another naughty one. She was one of the older girls, around 14, and was funny. She would let everyone know of her disagreement with some rule or order, shouting, ... storming off...
- Sorya was this extremely creative kid. He was full of energy and cheek.
- I could go on...

In the end, I found it very hard to leave the orphanage.

In hindsight what I did is terrible. I left the people I care about to suffer, from; malnutrition, lack of utilities (water, power, ...), corporal punishment, poor education, discrimination, a high risk of death... I abandoned them and tried to forget it. They need my help and everyday I say, "no thanks, I would rather spend my time and money on myself." (What kind of person does that?)

Living with this choice is the hard part.

### A shit person

I had gone though my life thinking I was a good person. I went to uni like a good boy does, I was on the committee of an NGO (EWB), I donated to charities, ... I was kind, friendly, what else am I supposed to do...? Going to India shattered this illusion.

How can I call myself a good person when the money I just used to buy; my latest item of clothing, a drink at a bar, ... could have saved a life. When I could have been campaigning and raising awareness of others suffering, rather than watching some movie or just chilling out. No longer was this a figure of speech, I had seen what money and time could do. Ten dollars could feed a family for a month, families I had met. A hundred dollars could save children from a lifetime of sex slavery, girls I had met. (Individually we could help soo many people, and I think this is a scary thought).

At some point I finally accepted that I am not a good person. Not even close.

### Its just too big

So I spent 3 months of my time trying to help these children, and what did I achieve? Nothing. I am pretty sure the staff will go back to beating the children once I have left. I doubt any of the projects I worked on (solar power, better education, ...?) will end up being started, let alone finished. And how many abandoned children are not even in orphanages? Millions...

While there, I realised that many of the deeper problems I wanted to fix were cultural and political. It is hard to fathom changing the beliefs of a billion people (especially when you cannot even change a couple of staff members) to think that; men and women should be equals, being wealthy does not mean you deserve respect, ... (but why are my beliefs better? It's not like I have any objective ground to stand on here) I mean this is a place where; sexism is encoded into law (e.g. mothers do not have rights to their children, unless the father gives it or is dead), common educational practices (corporal punishment and wrote learning) teach people to obey, not to think critically, dalits are left to starve in the streets while food is thrown away...

### Solution?

My way of dealing with these problems was willful ignorance/distraction. Which seems like the solution of choice to deal with painful realities (it is easier to live in a world where they don't exist). My method of choice was gaming, in particular 4 months of GW2 cured me.

Lately I have been becoming more optimistic (even in the face of ISIL, Trump, Brexit, ...) about changing human nature, solving political issues and in general, the future. I think this has been significantly aided by; Steven Pinker's _The better angels of our nature_, the effective altruism movement, and a slow revival of my social life.

I wish I could give you a better explanation of how I came out of my depression. A method that others could use, but I don't really know how it happened. I just count myself lucky that it didn't end like so many other depressions do.

### Lessons

I think that when people are angry, accusatory, depressed, hurtful, it is because they are angry, guilty, disgusted and hurt by/with themselves. Not liking yourself can cause serious psychological issues. I am sorry that I hurt people during this time.

I am no different to those people I deplore for being apathetic to political issues. They don't want to live in a world where these things are issues, so they construct a better world, an imaginary one. Where they couldn't possibly solve any of these problems, or where these problems don't even exist.

A new understanding of what it means to have (had) depression. It is not something that goes away (at least so far) but more like a scar that you carry around with you.

* * *

To sum up, I tried to care for others, but it hurt too much. So instead I now try to forget about the suffering of others. To those who do care, I respect you, I really do. You are doing what I couldn't, and are far braver than me.

I failed at caring once, however I could try again. So why don't I?
