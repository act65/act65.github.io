I really enjoyed this! This is a book about 'wanjala', the hunger season in Kenya. How can farmers of maize, be net buyers of maize? How can farmers be starving? These are the questions that the One Acre Fund are solving. They provide micro credit, insurance, education, fertilizer and technology (seeds).

I love how much these Kenyan farmers value education. We hear about a 50 year old learning to drive, a mother learning to trade stocks, children dedicating themselves to their schooling, parents risking it all ... For example, we hear of Leonida, risking starvation, going hungry for days, ... so she could afford to keep her son in school.

As much as I applaud their value of education, it make me sad. In first world countries we have far more resources and yet people don't seem to care about education here.

The technologist in me was intrigued by how each seed variety could be tailored to local conditions. Locations with high rainfall should have species with resistance to root rot, other locations might need to be drought resistant, etc... So we are looking for an optimal allocation of species given data on soil quality, weather patterns, ...?

Important points to note:

- Increasing the efficiency of farm land means forests do not need to cleared to make way for more farm land. It gives an alternative way to scale production.
- It isnt widely agreed that helping small farmers is the best way to develop countries. Industrialisation of farming (larger farms with better tech -- tractors, irrigation systems, ...) is more efficient.
- One Acre Fund has an unusual business model. Charge your customers at roughly the cost of production. Operational costs, research, ... are covered by donations.

Favorite quotes:

> Democrats countered that foreign aid was a crucial deployment of America’s “soft power,” and top-ranking voices in the Pentagon, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top military commander General David Petraeus, strongly supported development spending and USAID funding. They insisted that bread, and particularly bread made from crops grown by smallholder farmers in the developing world, was far better than bullets.
