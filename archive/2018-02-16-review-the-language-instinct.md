### Linguistic relativity

Pinker seemed against linguistic relativity, although I am not sure I understood his arguments correctly. I still think language must effect thought, it seems self-evident. However, the amount that it can effect thought may be slight and subtle.

How cool would it be if we had to indicate the source of any claim we made using a suffix (whether we observed it, according to the media, according to reproduced studied). Surely this would help people keep track of things that are likely to be true?

And/or counterfactuals in English versus Chinese. So although the Alfred Bloom study on English vs Chinese was debunked due to poor translation. I am still curious about a weaker test where the time taken to understand a counterfactual is measured. It doesn't surprise me that languages are universal, but the important part is how they encode information and which information is easier to represent.

### Structure

There are many types of verb. For example, you can devour something but you cant dine it. There is more structure within verbs depending on their meaning. A kind of type system structured by how the actions are done in the real world!?

The structure of language is influenced by the physics of our mouths, vocal folds and trachea. (stopping constants, ...)

Want, statistical evidence for the structure of language. While Pinker's examples were nice, I didn't find them totally convincing (we are easy to deceive). What sorts of statistical analysis would even reveal the structure within languages?

Other questions;

- What is grammar for?
- What makes a noun a noun? Its position in a syntax tree?

### Representation

Sam sprayed paint onto the wall. Sam sprayed the wall with paint. Paint was sprayed onto the wall by Sam. The wall was sprayed with paint by Sam.

According to Pinker these are synonymous. And in some sense mean the same thing. But, they also mean different things. Each one frames the scene; paint, wall, Sam, in a slightly different way, drawing attention to different parts of the scene. So each sentence is not equivalent?

Nouns tend to be objects. Verbs tend to be processes/changes/morphisms. This reminds me of a graph, with nodes and edges. But;

- verbs can be turned into nouns and vice versa!? (nodes and edges are not normally interchangeable)
- verbs can exist by themselves. "Walk" (or is it something different now? a command?)
- verbs can act on only one noun. It rains. (and edge with a free end)
- ?

Nouns and verbs are a factorisation of reality? Assume we have n objects (represented as nouns) and m actions (represented as verbs). Then we have \`​nxnxm\` possibilities, but only need to learn n + m lessons. Is this factorisation optimal? Depends on the structure of reality.

### Learning

The "Gavagai" problem. A rabbit runs past and a native shouts "Gavagai" while pointing at the rabbit. What does "Gavagai" mean? A running rabbit? A furry thing? Dinner? The tree in the background? A cottontail rabbit? A female rabbit? A mammal? Hey look I am pointing? Run for your life that thing is dangerous? ...

How is it possible to learn a general pattern when there are many exceptions, ie irregular verbs. This seems like a super hard problem!? Want to explore.

How is it possible to learn ~45,000 words!?! To do it with such a small sample complexity. While also having to learn about the world, grammar, disentangle atomic word structure, deal with noise, ...

The "biff" experiments. What level to generalise about a given object? Shown a porcelain cup and told that it is a "biff". If you don't already know what the name of that object is you will assume that all cup shaped things are also called "biff". But, if you already know that a cup is named "cup" then you assume "biff" refers to a specific aspect of the one in front of you. In this case, the fact that it is made out of porcelain. Thus a "biff" is a porcelain cup.

### Comparative linguistics

There are universal structures between all languages. These structures seems to be very high level to me, indicating there really isnt much similarity. Although I am unaware of how two languages can vary so maybe the fact that there is any similarity is astounding.

How can/should similarity between languages be measured? What would prove the universal grammar theory?

Various ways languages can differ;

- Isolating
- fixed word order
- accusative vs eragtive
- subject vs topic prominent
- SVO, SOV, ...
- classifier

### Evolution

> Why might it pay for the child to learn parts of a language rather than having the whole system hardwired?

Potential reasons;

- Allows language to evolve quicker? (if a new phenomena is experience it can be learned by the brain, rather than learned by natural selection)
- Too much DNA required, makes
- ?

What are the ways a language can mutate? (Misinterpretation. Erosion. ...)

What are the various selection pressures and advantages that different parts of language provide?!

### Cognitive science

Online parsing of natural language. Need to construct trees, but dont have all the information yet. This is what working memory solves!? To hold unresolved/dangling structures until they have been made precise by their context (semantics, syntax, ...).

Currently good progress on spatial memory and reinforcement learning. Want equivalent for language.

Our ability to encode/decode from visual to language based representations seems quite interesting. Pinker doesn't really touch on this, seems like a good avenue of future research.

> If lists of universals show that languages do not vary freely, do they imply that languages are restricted by the structure of the brain?

Possibly. Confounding factors are;

- accidents in linguistic evolution (All languages evolved from the same origin so of course they share similarities -- supposedly refuted by ??),
- similar environments (because people were faced with similar goals and ... of course we ...?),
- a global optima (regardless of brain structure, the most efficient way is X, so brains will adapt to do X since they are somewhat flexible).

### Thoughts

- Look into creolization and grammaticalisation.
- Want to learn Maori.
- A child can learn the structure of a language in ~3 years. Linguistics, with thousands of people many resources, has taken decades. (the key different being that one can explain their understanding while the other cannot)
- Want. A tool that helps visualise; grammar, morphology, phonology, ... That allows me to easily convert sentence between left -> right branching. To track extended metaphors for consistency. To change the metre of a sentence by automatically swapping synonyms with the desired onset/rime.
- Want to look into the abstract algebra/category theory of linguistics. Can the various structures and rules be written as an objects and algebras? What are their symmetries? Is there meta-level structure?
